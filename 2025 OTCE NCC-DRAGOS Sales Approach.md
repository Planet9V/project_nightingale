**Proposed Approach – NCC/Dragos NA account swap**

We propose leveraging specialized threat intelligence reports from Dragos to engage our energy sector prospects. The attached “PLC Password Cracking report” is one of Dragos’ premium products from their “concierge service” and aligns to World View.  Materials like this  demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing technical vulnerability information that directly relates to a prospect's infrastructure.

Our campaign would begin with targeted outreach highlighting specific vulnerabilities in technologies we know the prospect has deployed, based on our research. This creates immediate relevance and demonstrates our technical understanding of their environment.

Based on our work in the industry NCC OTCE has identified five high-value intelligence assets relevant to our current list of prospects:

1. DERMS vulnerability analysis for microgrid management  
2. SAP S4HANA security vulnerabilities at the IT/OT boundary  
3. Firmware exploits affecting low-voltage monitoring devices  
4. Command injection vulnerabilities in Virtual Power Plant architectures  
5. Landis & Gyr smart meter vulnerabilities

**Plan**: We will work with Dragos intelligence and  concierge service (including World View) to prepare a “light versions”  aligned to the account swap prospects (not calling out the actual organization but “examples in a general sense.” One or more of the above will be relevant – (At least).   Also under consideration is  developing a series of outreach with possible “teasers” of the content, to get first contact to obtain the actual product. 

**Questions**

* Can we offer a “gated” registration process to access this product (s)? Like a single purpose landing page?  
* If we go broader, beyond the account swap list – can we expand this out to a more structured email campaign?  
* Dragos has co-branded material capabilities – we nee dto apply current NCC colors/logs to them for use  
* Dragos has email campaign and attends several events, they can also distribute these- or direct ot the gated site –   
* We plan on AMs joining Dragos at different events, so having some materials would be of significance/

The primary purpose is to pursue the “account swap list” but this could be leveraged for other prospects of comparable profiles (like their competitors) – so a landing page could prove to be useful if we can post to Linkeninn and generate interest. I have a few thousand followers – if I post I get a petty good hit rate. There are some others at NCC that could do the same.
