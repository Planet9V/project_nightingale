## üîß COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: Placeholder Contact Information**
**Finding**: "[CIO Name]" or "[Email]" in profiles
**Fix**: 
1. Check `/prospect_research/prospect_research_[company].md`
2. Use WebSearch: "[Company] CIO email 2024"
3. Try mcp__tavily__tavily-search for LinkedIn
4. Document as "unavailable" only if not found

### **Issue 2: Missing Quick Reference Table**
**Finding**: No summary table in Section 3
**Fix**: Create table with all prospects:
```markdown
| Company | Primary DM | Tech Lead | Theme | Appendix |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| [Actual data from research files and CSV] |
```

### **Issue 3: Generic Email Templates**
**Finding**: Templates say "[INDUSTRY]" or "[SECTOR]"
**Fix**: Customize for specific industry:
- Oil & Gas: drilling, pipeline, refinery focus
- Chemical: CFATS, process safety emphasis
- Manufacturing: production, quality, efficiency

### **Issue 4: Incomplete Prospect Profiles**
**Finding**: "Continue with remaining prospects..."
**Fix**: Create full profile for EVERY assigned prospect
