## Project Overview

This is Project Nightingale, a critical infrastructure cybersecurity campaign focused on "Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren." The project creates executive-level go-to-market artifacts for energy and industrial companies using a proven tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard).
