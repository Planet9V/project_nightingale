This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Project Nightingale, a critical infrastructure cybersecurity campaign focused on "Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren." The project creates executive-level go-to-market artifacts for energy and industrial companies using a proven tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard).

**ENHANCED INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES (June 2025)**: 
- 100,406+ automated intelligence sources (CISA, GitHub repositories, annual reports)
- 9-theme service specialization for precision prospect targeting
- Real-time vulnerability intelligence using CISA KEV and enrichment data
- Single-command themed prospect generation with comprehensive automation

## Project Status and Session Continuity

**Current Status**: STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENT PHASE - GTM Strategy Implementation in Progress
**Base Completion**: 49/49 prospects (100%) with 630+ artifacts completed June 6, 2025
**Enhancement Phase**: January 6, 2025 - Strategic GTM enhancement implementation
**Current Priority**: Account Manager playbooks, landing pages, consultation frameworks
**SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: `PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_STRATEGIC_ENHANCEMENT_MASTER_TRACKER.md`
**Critical Dependency**: TExpress Attack Brief examples for Prime magnet integration

## Core Architecture

### Enhanced Intelligence Pipeline (June 2025)
**CRITICAL**: Always execute intelligence updates BEFORE prospect generation for current threat data.

#### **3-Layer Intelligence System**
```
LAYER 1: FOUNDATION INTELLIGENCE (Pre-Curated)
â”œâ”€â”€ 377 Annual Reports (2021-2025) categorized by theme
â”œâ”€â”€ 98,681 CISA vulnerability files (vulnrichment repository)
â”œâ”€â”€ Academic papers and cybersecurity datasets
â””â”€â”€ Partner intelligence (Dragos, Adelard, NCC OTCE)

LAYER 2: CURRENT INTELLIGENCE (Auto-Updated)  
â”œâ”€â”€ CISA KEV database (14 data files)
â”œâ”€â”€ Current threat feeds via MCP
â”œâ”€â”€ Industry-specific vulnerability tracking
â””â”€â”€ Partner capability updates

LAYER 3: PROSPECT-SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE (On-Demand)
â”œâ”€â”€ Company-specific vulnerability analysis  
â”œâ”€â”€ Theme-aligned threat intelligence
â”œâ”€â”€ Industry-focused current events
â””â”€â”€ Tri-partner opportunity assessment
```

#### **9-Theme Service Specialization**
- **SCV** - Supply Chain Vulnerability (98,342 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **IEC** - IEC 62443 Compliance (10 relevant vulnerabilities)  
- **ITC** - IT/OT Convergence Security (46,033 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **LCR** - Legacy Codebase Risk (223 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **PLM** - Product Lifecycle Monitoring (4,304 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **SCA** - Safety Case Analysis (27 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **NVC** - Network Visibility & Compliance (169 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **RIA** - Ransomware Impact Assessment (240 relevant vulnerabilities)
- **MDA** - M&A Due Diligence (98,676 relevant vulnerabilities)

### Standard Project Nightingale Artifact Framework
Each account requires exactly 10 standardized artifacts (now with theme enhancement):
1. GTM Part 1: Organization Profile & Technical Infrastructure
2. GTM Part 2: Operational Analysis & Strategic Sales Intelligence
3. GTM Part 3: Decision-Maker Profiles & Engagement Strategy
4. Local Intelligence Integration (2025 threat reports + current intelligence)
5. Sector Enhancement Analysis (theme-specialized)
6. Threat Landscape Analysis (CISA vulnerability intelligence integrated)
7. Regulatory Compliance Research (theme-specific standards)
8. Ransomware Impact Assessment (universal baseline)
9. M&A Due Diligence Analysis (universal baseline)
10. Executive Concierge Report (theme-customized)
