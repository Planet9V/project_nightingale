# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is Project Nightingale, a critical infrastructure cybersecurity campaign focused on "Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren." The project creates executive-level go-to-market artifacts for energy and industrial companies using a proven tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard).

```

## Core Architecture

### Project Nightingale Artifact Framework
Each account requires exactly 10 standardized artifacts:
1. GTM Part 1: Organization Profile & Technical Infrastructure
2. GTM Part 2: Operational Analysis & Strategic Sales Intelligence
3. GTM Part 3: Decision-Maker Profiles & Engagement Strategy
4. Local Intelligence Integration (2025 threat reports)
5. Sector Enhancement Analysis
6. Threat Landscape Analysis
7. Regulatory Compliance Research
8. Ransomware Impact Assessment
9. M&A Due Diligence Analysis
10. Executive Concierge Report

### File Organization Structure
```
/prospects/[Account_ID]_[Company_Name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [Company]_[Artifact_Type]_Project_Nightingale.md
â””â”€â”€ [9 more artifacts following same naming convention]
```

### Tier 1 Optimization Framework (Current Standard)
The proven optimization approach provides 40% efficiency improvement:

1. **Research Repository Leverage** (50-70% time savings)
   - Check `/prospect_research/prospect_research_[company].md` first
   - Prioritize accounts with 400+ line research files

2. **Enhanced Template System** (30-40% efficiency improvement)
   - Use templates from `PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ENHANCED_TEMPLATES.md`
   - Apply standardized frameworks for consistent quality

3. **Dragos 5 Intelligence Assets Integration**
   - DERMS vulnerability analysis
   - SAP S4HANA security vulnerabilities  
   - Firmware exploits in monitoring devices
   - Command injection vulnerabilities in VPP architectures
   - Landis & Gyr smart meter vulnerabilities

## Essential Commands

### Project Status and Tracking
```bash
# Check current project status
cat PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST.md | head -20

# Review optimization framework
cat PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ENHANCED_TEMPLATES.md

# Check session handoff guide
cat SESSION_HANDOFF_GUIDE.md

# Verify artifact counts
find /home/jim/gtm-campaign-project/prospects -name "*Project_Nightingale.md" | wc -l
```

### Optimal Batch Execution Session Restart
```bash
# Review optimal batch execution plan
cat OPTIMAL_BATCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md | head -30

# Initialize Batch 1A immediate execution todo tracking
TodoWrite [{"id": "1", "content": "Execute A-109140 CenterPoint Energy Inc using existing research (601 lines) - Batch 1A", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"}, {"id": "2", "content": "Prepare for Batch 1B when user provides research for 5 perfect alignment prospects", "status": "pending", "priority": "high"}, {"id": "3", "content": "Verify A-094599 Eversource Energy empty folder and complete if needed", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium"}]

# Review entity-based completion status
cat MASTER_LIST_VS_COMPLETED_SIDE_BY_SIDE.md | head -50

# Check available research for Batch 1A
echo "CenterPoint Energy: $(wc -l < prospect_research/prospect_research_CenterPoint_Energy.md) lines"
echo "Entity duplicates resolved: McDonald's (A-027659=A-129751) & PepsiCo (A-037991=A-110753)"
```

### Artifact Creation Process
```bash
# Standard workflow for each account:
# 1. Check research: /prospect_research/prospect_research_[company].md
# 2. Apply templates: PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ENHANCED_TEMPLATES.md  
# 3. Create directory: /prospects/[Account_ID]_[Company_Name]/
# 4. Generate 10 artifacts with naming: [Company]_[Artifact_Type]_Project_Nightingale.md
# 5. Update checklist: PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ARTIFACT_CHECKLIST.md
```

### Data Source Integration
```bash
# Leverage comprehensive intelligence repositories:
# Annual threat reports: /Annual_cyber_reports/Annual_cyber_reports_2025/
# Current advisories: /Current_advisories_2025_7_1/
# Threat analysis: /support_threat_analysis/
# Dragos intelligence: /Dragos_information/
# Executive frameworks: /executive-analysis/
```
