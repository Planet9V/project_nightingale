## ‚ùå Unfinished Tasks - Project Seldon Enhancement

The user requested a comprehensive review and enhancement of Project Seldon with 20% increased detail. The following research and analysis tasks were identified but NOT completed:

### Research Tasks (0/10 completed):
- [ ] Research latest graph database optimization techniques for 6-hop queries
- [ ] Analyze vector database scaling patterns and limitations
- [ ] Review ETL pipeline bottlenecks and failure modes
- [ ] Evaluate Neo4j-Pinecone synchronization challenges
- [ ] Assess mathematical model computational complexity
- [ ] Review security architecture for zero-trust compliance
- [ ] Analyze prompt chaining latency and error propagation
- [ ] Evaluate MCP server failover and redundancy
- [ ] Review data versioning conflict resolution
- [ ] Assess OpenSPG integration complexity

### Specific Focus Areas Mentioned:
1. **OpenSPG Integration** - This was specifically called out as needing attention
2. **Data Synchronization** - Neo4j-Pinecone sync architecture needs detailed review
3. **Data Versioning Conflict Resolution** - Critical for maintaining consistency across systems
4. **Performance Optimization** - 6-hop query optimization in Neo4j
5. **Security Enhancements** - Zero-trust compliance review

## üéØ Next Session Priority

**Start with**: Project Seldon comprehensive review and enhancement
- Target: 20% increase in architectural detail
- Focus: OpenSPG integration and data synchronization
- Method: Parallel research using Task agents for efficiency

**Suggested First Command**:
```
Claude, please continue the Project Seldon enhancement from the previous session. Start by:
1. Reading SESSION_HANDOFF_JUNE_12_2025.md for context
2. Using Task agents to research the 10 identified areas in parallel
3. Focus especially on OpenSPG integration and Neo4j-Pinecone synchronization
4. Enhance Project Seldon documentation by 20% based on findings
```
