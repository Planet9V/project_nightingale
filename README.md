# GTM Campaign Project (Project Nightingale)

This project contains go-to-market campaign materials, prospect research, and cybersecurity intelligence resources.

## üîß Claude Code MCP Server Integration

**Auto-Available**: 9 MCP servers are pre-configured and automatically available in every Claude Code session:

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Advanced File Operations** - Enhanced filesystem access
- **AI-Powered Search** - Tavily and Brave search integration  
- **Web Data Retrieval** - Advanced scraping capabilities
- **Database Integration** - Vector (Qdrant) and PostgreSQL support
- **Workflow Automation** - n8n cloud and local integration
- **Task Management** - Claude task coordination
- **System Utilities** - Windows automation tools

### Quick Start
```bash
claude mcp list              # See all available servers
claude mcp get <server>      # Get server details
```

All API keys are pre-configured. See `CLAUDE.md` for complete MCP documentation.
