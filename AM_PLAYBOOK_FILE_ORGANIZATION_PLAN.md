# AM Playbook File Organization Plan
## Resolving Version Confusion & Establishing Clear Structure

**Current Problem**: Multiple versions of AM playbooks exist in different locations, causing confusion  
**Solution**: Clear file organization with single source of truth

## 🗂️ CURRENT STATE - CONFUSING STRUCTURE

```
/Project_nightingale_process_start_here/
├── JEB_CARTER_COMPREHENSIVE_ENERGY_INDUSTRIAL_LEAD_AM_PLAYBOOK_OFFICIAL.md (v3.0)
├── JEB_CARTER_COMPREHENSIVE_ENERGY_INDUSTRIAL_LEAD_AM_PLAYBOOK_V4_1_OFFICIAL.md (v4.1)
├── WILLIAM_FILOSA_COMPREHENSIVE_MANUFACTURING_TRANSPORTATION_AM_PLAYBOOK_OFFICIAL.md (v3.0)
├── WILLIAM_FILOSA_COMPREHENSIVE_MANUFACTURING_TRANSPORTATION_AM_PLAYBOOK_V4_1_OFFICIAL.md (v4.1)
├── [Multiple other duplicate versions...]
└── /Account Manager Playbooks by Account Manager/
    ├── [More v4.1 versions]
    └── [Some unique files]
```

**Issues**:
- Duplicate files with different versions
- Unclear which is authoritative
- Risk of using outdated versions
- Confusion about file locations

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Backup Current State** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create backup
mkdir -p /Backup_AM_Playbooks_June9_2025
cp -r /Project_nightingale_process_start_here/*.md /Backup_AM_Playbooks_June9_2025/
```

### **Step 2: Create New Directory Structure** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Create organized directories
mkdir -p /Project_nightingale_process_start_here/ACTIVE_AM_Playbooks_v4_1
mkdir -p /Project_nightingale_process_start_here/AM_Appendix_Files
mkdir -p /Project_nightingale_process_start_here/Archive_Previous_Versions/v3_0_Playbooks
```

### **Step 3: Move V4.1 Files to Active Directory** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Move all V4.1 files to active directory
mv *V4_1_OFFICIAL.md ACTIVE_AM_Playbooks_v4_1/
mv *V4_1_COMPLETE.md ACTIVE_AM_Playbooks_v4_1/

# Rename for clarity (remove redundant text)
cd ACTIVE_AM_Playbooks_v4_1/
# Rename files to shorter, clearer names
```

### **Step 4: Archive Older Versions** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Move v3.0 versions to archive
mv *_OFFICIAL.md Archive_Previous_Versions/v3_0_Playbooks/
```

### **Step 5: Organize Appendix Files** (45 minutes)
```bash
# Create AM-specific appendix directories
mkdir AM_Appendix_Files/Jim_Vranicar_Appendices
mkdir AM_Appendix_Files/Jeb_Carter_Appendices
# ... etc for each AM

# Move appendix files to appropriate directories
mv JEB_CARTER_APPENDIX_*.md AM_Appendix_Files/Jeb_Carter_Appendices/
mv WILLIAM_FILOSA_APPENDIX_*.md AM_Appendix_Files/William_Filosa_Appendices/
# ... etc
```

### **Step 6: Create Index Documentation** (30 minutes)
Create `AM_PLAYBOOKS_INDEX.md` with:
- Active playbook locations
- Version information
- Last update dates
- Quick reference guide

---

## 📊 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

### **Standardized Naming Pattern**
```
Format: [AM_FIRSTNAME]_[AM_LASTNAME]_[Territory]_V[Version].md

Examples:
- JIM_VRANICAR_Energy_Sector_V4_1.md
- JEB_CARTER_Oil_Gas_V4_1.md
- WILLIAM_FILOSA_Manufacturing_V4_1.md
```

### **Benefits**:
- Clear version identification
- Consistent format
- Easy alphabetical sorting
- No confusion about which is current

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Communication Plan**
Send notification to all AMs:
```
Subject: AM Playbook Location Update - Action Required

The AM playbooks have been reorganized for clarity:
- NEW LOCATION: /ACTIVE_AM_Playbooks_v4_1/
- Your playbook: [AM_NAME]_V4_1.md
- Old versions archived for reference
- Please bookmark the new location
```

### **2. Access Permissions**
- Set ACTIVE directory as read-only for AMs
- Admin write access only
- Archive directory restricted access

### **3. Update Documentation**
Update all references in:
- PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_MASTER_STATUS_TRACKER.md
- CLAUDE.md
- README files
- Training materials
