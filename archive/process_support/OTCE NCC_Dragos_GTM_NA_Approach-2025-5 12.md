**OTCE NCC/Dragos Account Swap Pursuit  \- Energy Sector**    
**update:2025-5-12**

**Proposed Approach – NCC/Dragos NA account swap** 

We propose leveraging specialized threat intelligence reports from Dragos to engage our energy sector prospects in the  swap list.  The attached “PLC Password Cracking report” is one of Dragos’ premium products from their “concierge service” and aligns to World View, their premium TI service.  Materials like this  demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing technical vulnerability information that directly relates to a prospect's infrastructure.   
   
Our campaign would begin with targeted outreach highlighting specific vulnerabilities in technologies we **know** the prospect has deployed, based on our OSINT research. This creates immediate relevance and demonstrates our technical understanding of their environment. Our focus will be on the ideal personas – COO, CFO, CTO – and CISO – but more on the operations side.  

Based on our work in the industry NCC OTCE has identified five high-value intelligence assets relevant to our current list of prospects: 

* DERMS vulnerability analysis for microgrid management   
* SAP S4HANA security vulnerabilities at the IT/OT boundary   
* Firmware exploits affecting low-voltage monitoring devices   
* Command injection vulnerabilities in Virtual Power Plant architectures   
* Landis & Gyr smart meter vulnerabilities 

**Plan**: We will work with Dragos intelligence and  concierge service (including World View) to prepare  “light versions”  aligned to the account swap prospects (not calling out the actual organization but “examples in a general sense.”) One or more of the above will be relevant – (At least).   Also ,under consideration is  developing a series of outreach with possible “teasers” of the content, to get first contact to obtain the actual product.  

**Questions for Marketing** 

* Can we offer a “gated” registration process to access this product (s)? Like a single purpose landing page? We would need one for each “Asset”  
* If we go broader, beyond the account swap list – can we expand this out to a more structured email campaign? 

**Landing Page (Gate) Template Requirement**

* List what is required for the FORM for the Landing Page   
* Need asset for each landing page (gate)  

**Other considerations**

* Dragos has co-branded material capabilities – we need to apply **current** NCC brand   
* Dragos has email campaign and attends several events, they can also distribute these- or direct ot the gated site – focused on specific profiles (push toward specific Gated site (Asset) relevant to that customer profile  
* Printed materials for AMs attending sites, also to drop on Dragos sponsored tables at their events

**Sector Specific Assets for Concierge**

- **Energy – RNG** (Renewable Natural Gas) – this is an industry O\&G is investing heavily in (Exxon, BP etc). lots of activity in the TI space for disruption, many acquisitions  
  * DERMS vulnerability analysis for microgrid management   
  * SAP S4HANA security vulnerabilities at the IT/OT boundary   
- **2 \- Data Center –** (Black Rock, MS, etc. – Data centers are being built quickly – the cooling, energy etc all are critical (plus telco) – Dragos already has a decent amount of customers in this space)  
  * HVAC/Cooling/Building Management Systems, Physical Access Control vulnerabilities  \- discuss physical access for RFID (high frequency versus low frequency) issues  
- **4 \- Energy Distribution**  (Distributed Energy Resources – (Solar/Wind) energy transmission and distribution (micro grids, municipalities, private equity firms investing in multiple ventures – (This would cover world \- Americas, EMEA, ANZ etc.)  
  * Firmware exploits affecting low-voltage monitoring devices   
  * Command injection vulnerabilities in Virtual Power Plant architectures   
  * Landis & Gyr smart meter vulnerabilities   
  * DERMS vulnerability analysis for microgrid management  
- 5 – **Amazon/Costco – Distribution Centers / Logistics**  
  * Attacks on remote access (including OTP) and successful bypassing of technologies like RSA Once time Use Token (OTP) to gain access to warehouse/distribution centers

**Sales Motion**

- Facility Due Diligence (using Dragos Platform) (Facility risk assessment, validation of security, Threat Intelligence/ Model) using Dragos TI and Platform  
- OT Retainer (if possible in NA via Drago pass-thru) – as “interim” Now activity, while they think about next steps  
- Product Security testing  
- Dragos World View  
- Secure Remote Access  
- Safety Related (Adelard) Services – merging Cyber Safety and Security via NCC/Adelard  
-
