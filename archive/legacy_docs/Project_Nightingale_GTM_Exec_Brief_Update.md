## Competitive Differentiation: Only provider combining Adelard safety + Dragos OT platform

### Four Key Differentiators:

1. **Only Tri-Partner Solution**
   - Adelard safety + Dragos OT + NCC consulting

2. **Zero-Impact Assessment**
   - No operational disruption unlike competitors

3. **Engineering-Led Approach**
   - OT-first vs. IT-centric methodologies

4. **Formal Safety Verification**
   - Mathematical certainty for critical functions

### 2. Strategic Imperatives & Approach:

Project Nightingale is built on several core pillars designed for maximum impact and scalability:

• **Americas Leading the Charge:** The Americas region will spearhead this initiative, establishing a replicable model for global rollout. This allows for focused execution and refinement before expansion.

• **Power of Partnerships -- A Triumvirate of Expertise:**
  - **Dragos:** Leveraging their leading OT threat intelligence and platform for enhanced detection and response capabilities within our offerings. This includes an account swap agreement to tap into high-value energy sector prospects, with the Dragos Platform providing unparalleled asset visibility through passive monitoring, Dragos WorldView delivering OT-specific threat intelligence, and the Dragos OT Retainer offering specialized incident response services.
  
  - **Adelard:** Fully integrating Adelard's deep safety case knowledge and ASCE platform. This allows us to address the converging worlds of cybersecurity and operational safety through deterministic verification methodologies, regulatory compliance expertise, and formal safety assessment capabilities—a key differentiator and client demand, especially in critical infrastructure.
  
  - **NCC IT Assurance Services:** Seamlessly incorporating relevant NCC IT service lines to provide comprehensive IT/OT security solutions, addressing the full spectrum of client digital risk through our technology-agnostic consulting approach.

**Combined Partnership Value:** This three-way partnership delivers a comprehensive approach to operational technology security and safety that enhances reliability rather than compromising it. Clients benefit from strategic guidance, tactical implementation support, specialized technology, safety case development, regulatory compliance expertise, and ongoing managed services—all delivered with an engineering-led mindset that puts operations first. Our unique combination provides

40% faster compliance achievement, zero-impact assessment methodologies, and the only solution in the market that mathematically verifies safety-critical functions while maintaining security posture.

• **Focus on High-Value, Specialized Services:** The campaign prioritizes nine distinct service themes addressing critical operational reliability and safety challenges, with initial emphasis on two high-impact areas:

**Initial Focus Areas:**

• **Ransomware Impact Assessment:** Preventing operational downtime and revenue loss through targeted defense strategies that ensure continuous delivery of essential services, with integrated safety impact analysis of ransomware scenarios and safety function isolation strategies.

• **M&A Due Diligence:** Avoiding post-acquisition surprises and securing accurate valuation through comprehensive assessment that protects reliability during organizational transitions, including safety certification validation and safety case integration assessment.

**Complete Nine-Theme Portfolio:**

4 Landing Page

• **Tight Alignment:** Fostering deep collaboration between Sales Account Managers (AMs) and OTCE Engineers. AMs will own the client relationship and translate value, while OTCE Engineers (supported by Adelard and Dragos experts) will deliver technical depth and customized solutions through structured 15-minute expert consultations.

• **Clear Roles & Responsibilities:** Defined engagement processes and responsibilities ensure a smooth client journey from initial outreach to opportunity development, supported by comprehensive pre-call preparation, personalized briefing documents, and structured follow-up protocols.

• **Data-Driven, Targeted Marketing:**
  - **Three-Stage Content Approach:** Progressive value delivery through OSINT Discovery Reports (intelligence foundation), Threat Analysis Reports (sector-specific vulnerability assessment), and Full Concierge Reports (comprehensive assessment with operational reliability focus).
  
  - **Marketing Landing Pages & Concierge Reports:** Utilizing dedicated landing pages for each campaign theme, offering high-value, gated "Full Concierge Reports" (synthesizing OSINT and threat analysis) to convert prospects, with integrated scheduling for expert consultations.
  
  - **Analytics-Driven Prospecting:** Leveraging analytics from the North America Sales team to identify and prioritize high-value prospects through the 50/50 account swap program (50 Dragos clients → NCC services, 50 NCC clients → Dragos platform). The campaign will initially target these key accounts, followed by a phased expansion to "stale" or under-engaged customers.

• **Modular & Scalable Global Model:** The campaign is designed with a modular approach, allowing for adaptation and replication across other regions. Following the Americas launch, a fast-follow is planned for ANZ, with EMEA and other regions to follow suit, leveraging the refined playbook and learnings from the four-phase implementation timeline (Preparation, Content Development, Campaign Launch, Expansion & Optimization).
