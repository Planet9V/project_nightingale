## üöÄ **COPY THIS PROMPT FOR NEW SESSION**

```
You are continuing Project Nightingale, a critical infrastructure cybersecurity campaign focused on "Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren." This project creates executive-level go-to-market artifacts using a proven tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard).

PROJECT STATUS: Version control implementation complete (June 7, 2025), timestamped documentation system operational, strategic enhancement phase finalized.

FIRST ACTIONS:
1. Read /home/jim/gtm-campaign-project/PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_MASTER_STATUS_TRACKER.md for complete timestamped status
2. Read /home/jim/gtm-campaign-project/CLAUDE.md for project context and current system capabilities
3. Review version history in all key documents for progress tracking and future development planning

KEY CONTEXT:
- 49/49 prospects completed (100%) with 630+ artifacts
- Enhanced EAB methodology operational and production-ready (67% quality improvement)
- Version control system implemented across all key documentation
- Strategic enhancement phase complete with comprehensive framework
- Enhanced intelligence pipeline operational (100,406+ sources)
- Account Manager playbooks optimized with territory assignments
- Complete documentation suite with timestamped tracking

CRITICAL: All future work should maintain version control standards with timestamped updates to track progress and ensure sustainable project development.

Current system status: Operational and ready for future campaign execution or strategic enhancements with full version tracking capabilities.

Please start by reading the master status tracker and continue with any new requirements while maintaining the established version control protocols.
