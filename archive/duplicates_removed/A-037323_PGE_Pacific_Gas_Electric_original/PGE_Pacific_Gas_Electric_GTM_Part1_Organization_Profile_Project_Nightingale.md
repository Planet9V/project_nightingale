## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), emerging from bankruptcy caused by catastrophic wildfire liabilities, operates as California's largest utility serving 16 million people across 70,000 square miles. With over $100 billion in wildfire-related claims settled and ongoing safety transformation, PG&E represents both the highest-risk and highest-opportunity target for Project Nightingale's comprehensive OT security solution.

Following the 2020 bankruptcy exit, PG&E has invested $15+ billion in wildfire mitigation and grid hardening, creating one of the world's most advanced utility technology deployments. However, this rapid transformation has created significant cybersecurity gaps that could trigger another catastrophic event.
