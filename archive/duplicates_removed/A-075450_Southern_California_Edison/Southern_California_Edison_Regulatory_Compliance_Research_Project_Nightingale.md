# PROJECT NIGHTINGALE - REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RESEARCH
## Southern California Edison - Multi-Jurisdictional Cybersecurity Requirements

**Target Organization:** Southern California Edison (SCE)  
**Account ID:** A-075450  
**Analysis Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Document Type:** Regulatory Compliance Framework Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Southern California Edison operates under the most complex regulatory cybersecurity framework in the United States, with overlapping requirements from federal (NERC CIP, TSA), state (CPUC), and industry-specific mandates focused on wildfire prevention. Non-compliance risks exceed $1 million per day in penalties plus potential criminal liability for wildfire-related failures.

**Critical Finding:** SCE faces 47 distinct cybersecurity compliance requirements across 6 regulatory frameworks, with California's unique wildfire liability laws creating strict liability exposure that makes cybersecurity failures potentially catastrophic to corporate viability.
