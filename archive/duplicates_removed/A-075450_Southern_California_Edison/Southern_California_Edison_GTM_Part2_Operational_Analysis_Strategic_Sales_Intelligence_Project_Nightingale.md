## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Southern California Edison's operational landscape is dominated by wildfire mitigation imperatives and aggressive clean energy mandates, creating unique cybersecurity challenges across their $42 billion rate base. SCE's extensive grid modernization program, including advanced weather monitoring systems, distribution automation, and PSPS decision-support platforms, requires sophisticated OT security that traditional IT approaches cannot address.

The convergence of physical safety (wildfire prevention) and cyber security presents an ideal opportunity for Project Nightingale's tri-partner solution, with potential to secure $500M+ in critical infrastructure investments while preventing catastrophic wildfire events that could cost billions.
