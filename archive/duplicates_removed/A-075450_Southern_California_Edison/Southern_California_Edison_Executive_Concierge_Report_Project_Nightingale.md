# PROJECT NIGHTINGALE - EXECUTIVE CONCIERGE REPORT
## Southern California Edison - Strategic Cybersecurity Partnership Proposal

**Target Organization:** Southern California Edison (SCE)  
**Account ID:** A-075450  
**Prepared For:** Steven Powell, President & CEO  
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Classification:** Executive Strategic Brief

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Southern California Edison faces an unprecedented convergence of wildfire risks and cyber threats that could trigger catastrophic events costing billions in liability. This executive briefing proposes a strategic partnership with Project Nightingale's tri-partner team to protect SCE's $5.9 billion wildfire mitigation investment while ensuring grid reliability for 15 million Californians.

**Critical Value Proposition:** Prevent a single cyber-induced wildfire event that could cost SCE $1-10 billion in liability while securing critical infrastructure that determines public safety power shutoff (PSPS) decisions affecting millions.

**Investment Required:** $25-30 million over 3 years  
**Quantified Return:** $500M+ in risk mitigation, operational savings, and regulatory compliance  
**Strategic Outcome:** Industry leadership in utility cybersecurity and wildfire prevention

---

## THE CRITICAL CHALLENGE

### Cyber Threats to Wildfire Systems
SCE operates 1,000+ weather stations and 350+ HD fire cameras that inform critical PSPS decisions. A cyberattack compromising these systems could:
- Provide false data leading to failure to de-energize before fire conditions
- Trigger unnecessary PSPS events costing $50-100M in economic impact
- Disable critical monitoring during extreme weather events
- Create liability exposure exceeding $10 billion

### Current State Gaps
- **Limited OT Security:** Traditional IT security tools cannot protect operational technology
- **Vendor Vulnerabilities:** 200+ vendors with varying security standards
- **Real-time Requirements:** Security measures cannot impede split-second decisions
- **Compliance Pressure:** Increasing regulatory scrutiny on grid cybersecurity
