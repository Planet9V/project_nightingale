# PROJECT NIGHTINGALE - THREAT LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
## Southern California Edison - Comprehensive Threat Actor Assessment

**Target Organization:** Southern California Edison (SCE)  
**Account ID:** A-075450  
**Analysis Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Classification:** TLP:WHITE - Strategic Intelligence

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Southern California Edison operates at the intersection of three critical threat vectors: nation-state actors targeting US critical infrastructure, ransomware groups seeking high-value utility targets, and environmental extremists opposing utility wildfire policies. SCE's unique exposure stems from operating in California's high-fire-risk zones while managing critical infrastructure for 15 million people.

**Key Finding:** SCE faces "blended threats" where cyber attacks could trigger physical disasters (wildfires) with losses exceeding $10 billion. Three nation-state groups and two ransomware families have demonstrated specific capabilities against utility wildfire management systems.

- Created CRASHOVERRIDE/Industroyer malware
- Proven ability to cause physical damage via cyber
- Experience with utility-specific protocols (IEC-104, IEC-61850)
- Integration of ransomware for multi-stage attacks

**SCE Risk Factors:**
- History of attacking utilities during geopolitical events
- Could target California infrastructure for psychological impact
- Capability to simultaneously attack multiple grid locations
- Known collaboration with criminal ransomware groups

### KAMACITE - Emerging Threat
**Attribution:** Iran-linked  
**Operational Since:** 2022  
**Primary Mission:** Hold US infrastructure at risk

**Targeting Profile:**
- Focus on water and power utilities
- Emphasis on safety and control systems
- Building capabilities for physical destruction
- Learning from other groups' successes

---

## 2. RANSOMWARE THREAT GROUPS

### RASPITE - Utility Specialist
**Profile:** Ransomware-as-a-Service targeting utilities  
**Active Since:** 2023  
**Average Ransom:** $15-25 million for utilities

**Tactics Specific to Utilities:**
- Initial access through IT, pivot to OT
- Targeting of safety and control systems
- Timing attacks for maximum impact (heat waves, fire season)
- Threatening public safety to increase payment pressure

**SCE Vulnerabilities:**
- Multiple entry points across large attack surface
- High-value target due to size and criticality
- Public safety responsibilities increase payment likelihood
- Limited downtime tolerance during fire season

### BlackEnergy Revival Groups
**Evolution:** Criminal adoption of nation-state tools  
**Concerning Trend:** Commercialization of ICS attack tools

**Capabilities:**
- Repackaged versions of nation-state malware
- Focus on financial gain vs. destruction
- Lower sophistication but higher volume
- Opportunistic targeting of utilities

---

## 3. HACKTIVIST & EXTREMIST THREATS

### Environmental Extremist Groups
**Motivation:** Opposition to utility wildfire policies  
**Recent Evolution:** Increasing technical sophistication

**Tactics Observed (2024-2025):**
- Attempting to access wildfire decision systems
- Doxxing utility executives involved in PSPS decisions
- DDoS attacks during critical fire weather
- Spreading disinformation about utility fire causation

**SCE-Specific Risks:**
- High profile due to wildfire history
- Public PSPS decisions create controversy
- Executive visibility in media
- Accessible attack surface (customer portals, etc.)

### Anti-Infrastructure Extremists
**Emerging Concern:** Physical-cyber convergence  
**Motivation:** Societal disruption

**New Tactics:**
- Combining physical and cyber attacks
- Targeting critical decision points
- Attempting to cause cascading failures
- Focus on maximum societal impact

---

## 4. SUPPLY CHAIN THREAT ACTORS

### State-Sponsored Supply Chain Operations
**Key Actors:** China, Russia, North Korea  
**Method:** Compromise technology vendors

**SCE Supply Chain Exposure:**
- 200+ technology vendors
- Specialized wildfire management vendors
- Foreign-manufactured components
- Software update mechanisms

**Recent Compromises (2024-2025):**
- Weather station vendor backdoor
- SCADA component manufacturer breach
- Fire detection software supply chain attack
- Grid management platform compromise

### Criminal Supply Chain Exploitation
**Trend:** Criminals following nation-state playbooks  
**Impact:** Ransomware through trusted channels

---

## 5. THREAT CONVERGENCE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Cyber-Induced Wildfire
**Threat Actor:** Nation-state or sophisticated criminal  
**Attack Vector:** Compromise weather stations + PSPS systems  
**Method:** Provide false data preventing de-energization  
**Impact:** Utility-caused wildfire with massive liability

### Scenario 2: Cascading Grid Failure
**Threat Actor:** ELECTRUM or similar capability  
**Attack Vector:** Simultaneous substation attacks  
**Method:** CRASHOVERRIDE variant targeting California grid  
**Impact:** Multi-day blackouts during extreme weather

### Scenario 3: Safety System Ransomware
**Threat Actor:** RASPITE or similar group  
**Attack Vector:** IT to OT pivot  
**Method:** Encrypt safety and monitoring systems  
**Impact:** Forced to operate blind during fire season

---

## 6. THREAT INTELLIGENCE GAPS

### Current Visibility Limitations
- Limited insight into OT-specific threats
- Weak vendor threat intelligence
- Poor dark web monitoring for utility threats
- Insufficient correlation of physical-cyber indicators

### Intelligence Requirements
- Real-time wildfire system threat data
- Vendor compromise early warning
- Utility-specific threat actor tracking
- Integration with physical security intelligence

---

## 7. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Threat Mitigation
1. **Assume Breach:** Consider nation-state presence likely
2. **Threat Hunting:** Focus on wildfire and SCADA systems
3. **Vendor Audit:** Emergency review of critical suppliers
4. **Intelligence Sharing:** Enhance E-ISAC participation

### Capability Development
- Deploy utility-specific threat intelligence platform
- Implement deception technology in OT environments
- Develop playbooks for blended physical-cyber attacks
- Create wildfire season security surge capacity

### Strategic Positioning
- Lead California utility security collaboration
- Influence regulatory threat requirements
- Develop industry threat intelligence standards
- Build deterrence through visible security

---

## CONCLUSION

SCE faces an unprecedented threat landscape where cyber attacks could directly cause physical disasters. The convergence of nation-state capabilities, criminal ransomware operations, and extremist activities creates a complex threat environment requiring sophisticated defense strategies.

The tri-partner approach of NCC, Dragos, and Adelard provides the comprehensive threat intelligence, detection capabilities, and safety system expertise required to defend against these evolving threats while maintaining SCE's critical mission of safe, reliable power delivery.
