## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Embedding Pipeline
```python
# Document processing flow
def process_document(file_path):
    # 1. Extract text and metadata
    content = extract_text(file_path)
    metadata = extract_metadata(file_path)
    
    # 2. Chunk intelligently
    chunks = semantic_chunking(content, max_tokens=512)
    
    # 3. Generate embeddings
    embeddings = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
            input=chunk,
            model="text-embedding-3-large",
            dimensions=1024
        )
        embeddings.append(embedding)
    
    # 4. Store in Pinecone
    vectors = []
    for i, (chunk, embedding) in enumerate(zip(chunks, embeddings)):
        vectors.append({
            "id": f"{file_path}_{i}",
            "values": embedding,
            "metadata": {
                **metadata,
                "chunk_index": i,
                "chunk_text": chunk[:1000]  # First 1000 chars
            }
        })
    
    pinecone_index.upsert(vectors=vectors)
```

### Search Architecture
```python
# Intelligent search with reranking
def semantic_search(query, filters=None, top_k=20):
    # 1. Generate query embedding
    query_embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
        input=query,
        model="text-embedding-3-large",
        dimensions=1024
    )
    
    # 2. Search Pinecone
    results = pinecone_index.query(
        vector=query_embedding,
        filter=filters,
        top_k=top_k,
        include_metadata=True
    )
    
    # 3. Rerank results
    reranked = rerank_results(query, results)
    
    # 4. Enhance with context
    enhanced_results = add_context(reranked)
    
    return enhanced_results
```

const chunks = await chunkDocument(document);
const vectors = await createVectors(chunks);
await index.upsert(vectors);
```

### Step 4: Perform First Search
```javascript
// Search for similar prospects
const results = await index.query({
  vector: await embed("ransomware vulnerable energy company"),
  topK: 5,
  includeMetadata: true
});
```
