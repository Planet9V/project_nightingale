## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Why This Report Matters Now

Ontario Power Generation faces an unprecedented convergence of cyber threats targeting North America's most ambitious nuclear modernization program at the exact moment of your G7-leading SMR deployment. With confirmed KAMACITE (Russian-linked APT) targeting nuclear facilities¹, the Black & McDonald ransomware attack exposing critical infrastructure vulnerabilities², and your $20.9 billion Darlington SMR project beginning construction³, your window for decisive action is narrowing rapidly.

**Critical Context**: As Ontario's largest electricity generator providing 50% of provincial power to 15 million residents while deploying first-of-kind nuclear technology, OPG's operational continuity directly impacts Canada's energy security and Project Nightingale's mission of clean water, reliable energy, and healthy food for future generations.

### Three Actions for Monday Morning

1. **Activate Nuclear APT Hunt** (Week 1)
   - Deploy specialized detection for KAMACITE nuclear facility targeting
   - Focus on PowerShell exploitation across nuclear control systems⁴
   - Establish CNSC coordination for cyber threat response

2. **Secure SMR Supply Chain** (Week 2)
   - Implement zero-trust architecture for GE-Hitachi technology transfer
   - Address Black & McDonald breach lessons for construction partners⁵
   - Protect $20.9B investment from supply chain compromise

3. **Launch Critical Infrastructure Transformation** (Week 3)
   - Elevate cybersecurity to Board-level nuclear safety priority
   - Announce "Protecting Ontario's Clean Energy Future" initiative
   - Position OPG as global SMR cybersecurity leader
