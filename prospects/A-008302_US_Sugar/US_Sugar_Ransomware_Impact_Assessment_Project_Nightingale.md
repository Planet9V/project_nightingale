## Executive Summary

US Sugar faces extreme ransomware exposure with food sector attacks doubling in Q1 2025 (84 incidents vs. 41 previous quarter). Food and Ag-ISAC warns cybercriminals are "tightening their grip on America's food supply" while US Sugar's vertically integrated operations spanning 245,000 acres to consumer brands create critical vulnerabilities. As the largest US sugarcane producer contributing 25% of national production, ransomware impact extends beyond corporate damage to national food security.

**Critical Risk Factor**: 76% of food manufacturing attacks originate from phishing emails targeting operations, while US Sugar's SAP S/4HANA transformation and Imperial Sugar integration create expanded attack surfaces during peak vulnerability.
