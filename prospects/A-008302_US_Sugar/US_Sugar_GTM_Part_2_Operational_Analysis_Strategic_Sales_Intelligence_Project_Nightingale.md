## Executive Summary

United States Sugar Corporation's strategic transformation through the $297 million Imperial Sugar acquisition and concurrent SAP S/4HANA implementation creates unprecedented operational technology vulnerabilities requiring immediate security enhancement. With 245,000 acres of agricultural operations, dual refineries processing 1.65 million tons annually, and a private railroad network, US Sugar represents critical food infrastructure supporting 10+ million American families' sugar consumption.

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- **SAP S/4HANA Migration**: IT/OT boundary vulnerabilities during 2024-2025 implementation
- **Imperial Sugar Integration**: Disparate control systems across Georgia and Kentucky facilities
- **Agricultural OT Exposure**: 42,000 tons/day sugarcane processing dependent on vulnerable SCADA
- **Supply Chain Criticality**: 15% of U.S. refined sugar production at risk from cyber disruption

The tri-partner solution (NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard) addresses these vulnerabilities while enhancing operational excellence, supporting US Sugar's vision as "the low-cost producer of high quality, refined sugar."
