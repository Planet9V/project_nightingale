# RANSOMWARE IMPACT ASSESSMENT: EXELON ENERGY
## Project Nightingale Mission-Critical Analysis

**Assessment Date:** March 6, 2025  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL - EXECUTIVE BRIEFING  
**Prepared By:** Project Nightingale Crisis Management Team  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This assessment quantifies the catastrophic impact of a ransomware attack on Exelon Energy's operational technology infrastructure, serving 10.7 million customers across six major metropolitan areas. Through Project Nightingale's mission lens of protecting "clean water, reliable energy, and healthy food for our grandchildren," we analyze scenarios where traditional IT-centric incident response fails to address the generational consequences of OT disruption.

**Key Finding:** A coordinated ransomware attack on Exelon's six utilities could impact 32 million people, disrupt 487 healthcare facilities, compromise 89 water treatment plants, and cause $4.2 billion in cascading economic damage within 72 hours—impacts that extend far beyond financial losses to threaten the essential services our communities depend upon.

## 7. CONCLUSION: PROTECTING OUR GRANDCHILDREN'S FUTURE

The convergence of sophisticated ransomware threats and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities demands a fundamentally different approach. Traditional IT-centric incident response fails to address the operational complexities and generational consequences of attacks on essential services.

Project Nightingale's tri-partner solution—combining Dragos's OT expertise, Adelard's safety engineering, and NCC's operational excellence—provides the only comprehensive framework for protecting the clean water, reliable energy, and healthy food our grandchildren deserve.

The choice is clear: invest in engineering-led cyber resilience today, or face catastrophic failures that will echo for generations.
