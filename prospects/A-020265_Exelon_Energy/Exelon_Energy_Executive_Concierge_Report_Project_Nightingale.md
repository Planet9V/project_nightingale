## ESSENTIAL SERVICES STEWARDSHIP: OUR GRANDCHILDREN'S ENERGY FUTURE

*"Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren"* - This Project Nightingale mission statement takes on profound urgency when considering Exelon Energy's responsibility for powering the essential services upon which 32 million people depend across six major metropolitan areas. As America's largest pure-play transmission and distribution utility, Exelon stands as guardian of critical infrastructure that powers 487 hospitals, 89 water treatment facilities, and 2,341 food distribution centers across Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, and Washington D.C.

**STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE:** The convergence of an unprecedented 11 GW data center surge, sophisticated nation-state threats specifically targeting electric utilities, and aging infrastructure creates a perfect storm requiring immediate intervention. A coordinated ransomware attack on Exelon's six utilities could impact 32 million people, disrupt 487 healthcare facilities, and cause $4.2 billion in cascading economic damage within 72 hours—consequences that extend far beyond financial losses to threaten the essential services our communities depend upon for generations.

## CONCLUSION: GUARDIAN OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

Exelon Energy stands at a critical juncture where the convergence of unprecedented demand growth, sophisticated cyber threats, and complex regulatory requirements demands a fundamentally different approach to operational security. Traditional IT-centric solutions fail to address the operational complexities and generational consequences of attacks on essential services infrastructure.

Project Nightingale's tri-partner solution—uniquely combining operational excellence methodology, purpose-built OT security, and mathematical safety assurance—provides the only comprehensive framework capable of protecting the clean water, reliable energy, and healthy food access that our grandchildren deserve.

The choice is clear: Invest in engineering-led operational excellence today to ensure essential services reliability for future generations, or face catastrophic failures that will echo across decades. Exelon's leadership in implementing this framework will position the organization not merely as an energy provider, but as guardian of operational excellence protecting the essential services upon which communities depend.

**The time for action is now. The future of essential services depends upon the decisions made today.**
