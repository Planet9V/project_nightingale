   - 87% increase in 2024 (Dragos report)
   - Exelon risk: HIGH (large attack surface)
   - Groups: LockBit 3.0, BlackCat, Royal

### 10.2 Security Architecture Overview

**Defense-in-Depth Strategy:**

```
Internet ──► DMZ ──► Corporate IT ──► OT DMZ ──► OT Networks
   │          │           │              │            │
Firewalls   WAF      Segmentation    Data Diode   Air Gap
   │          │           │              │            │
DDoS      App Sec    Zero Trust      Monitoring   Physical
```

**Key Security Controls:**
- Network segmentation: 6 security zones
- Multi-factor authentication: 95% coverage
- Privileged access management: CyberArk
- Vulnerability management: Rapid7
- Security orchestration: Phantom SOAR

### 10.3 OT-Specific Security Measures

**ICS Security Program:**
- Dedicated OT Security team: 25 FTEs
- 24/7 OT SOC monitoring
- Claroty deployment for visibility
- Incident response playbooks
- Annual GridEx participation

**Critical Control Validation:**
- NERC CIP compliance: 100%
- Security control testing: Quarterly
- Penetration testing: Annual
- Red team exercises: Bi-annual
- Tabletop exercises: Monthly

### 10.4 Security Metrics and Maturity

**2024 Security Performance:**
- Security incidents: 34 (none critical)
- Mean time to detect: 4.2 hours
- Mean time to respond: 2.1 hours
- Phishing click rate: 2.1% (improving)
- Patch compliance: 97% within SLA

**Maturity Assessment (NIST CSF):**
- Identify: Level 4 (Adaptive)
- Protect: Level 3 (Repeatable)
- Detect: Level 4 (Adaptive)
- Respond: Level 3 (Repeatable)
- Recover: Level 3 (Repeatable)

## Project Nightingale Alignment and Opportunities

### Operational Excellence Imperative

Exelon Energy exemplifies the critical infrastructure that Project Nightingale seeks to protect. With 10.7 million customers depending on Exelon for the electricity that powers water treatment plants, agricultural operations, food storage, hospitals, and homes, the company directly enables the "clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food" that must be preserved for our grandchildren.

### Key Vulnerabilities Requiring Tri-Partner Solution

1. **Explosive Data Center Growth**
   - 11 GW demand surge creating grid stress
   - New attack surface from hyperscale customers
   - **Dragos Value**: OT visibility for new interconnections
   - **Adelard Value**: Safety validation for grid stability
   - **NCC Value**: Zero-impact assessment of expanded infrastructure

2. **Aging Infrastructure Modernization**
   - $38B transformation with massive OT/IT convergence
   - Legacy system vulnerabilities during transition
   - **NCC Value**: Secure architecture design and validation
   - **Dragos Value**: Continuous monitoring during changes
   - **Adelard Value**: Safety case maintenance through transformation

3. **Multi-State Regulatory Complexity**
   - 6 jurisdictions with varying requirements
   - Compliance demonstration challenges
   - **NCC Value**: Unified compliance framework
   - **Dragos Value**: Evidence collection and reporting
   - **Adelard Value**: Mathematical verification for regulators

4. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
   - 450+ software vendors, 12,000+ contractors
   - Single points of failure in critical systems
   - **NCC Value**: Third-party risk assessment
   - **Dragos Value**: Supply chain threat intelligence
   - **Adelard Value**: Critical function protection

### Engineering Excellence Alignment

Exelon's strong engineering culture, inherited from its nuclear generation heritage, aligns perfectly with Project Nightingale's engineering-led approach. The company's focus on "event-free days" and systematic improvement matches the operational excellence philosophy that distinguishes the NCC-Dragos-Adelard partnership.

### Zero-Impact Assessment Critical

With 24/7 operations serving critical infrastructure, Exelon cannot tolerate any assessment approach that might impact reliability. NCC's zero-impact methodology, validated through nuclear industry experience, provides the only acceptable path for comprehensive security evaluation.

### Expected Outcomes from Partnership

1. **Operational Reliability**: 25-30% reduction in security-related events
2. **Regulatory Excellence**: Streamlined multi-state compliance
3. **Cost Efficiency**: $50-75M annual savings through optimized security
4. **Risk Reduction**: 40% improvement in overall security posture
5. **Industry Leadership**: Recognized as utility security leader

### Recommended Engagement Approach

Given Exelon's scale and complexity, a phased approach focusing initially on the data center interconnection challenges would provide immediate value while building toward enterprise-wide implementation. The Chicago operations, facing the most acute data center growth, represent an ideal starting point.
