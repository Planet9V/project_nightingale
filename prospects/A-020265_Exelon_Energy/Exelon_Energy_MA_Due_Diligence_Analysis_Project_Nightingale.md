# PROJECT NIGHTINGALE - M&A DUE DILIGENCE ANALYSIS
## Exelon Energy - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Strategic Transactions

**Target Organization:** Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC)  
**Account ID:** A-020265  
**Account Manager:** Jim Vranicar  
**Analysis Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Document Type:** M&A Due Diligence & Post-Transaction Integration Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Exelon Corporation's 2022 separation into pure-play utility (Exelon) and generation (Constellation) businesses represents one of the energy sector's most significant structural transformations. This analysis examines cybersecurity implications of Exelon's ongoing consolidation strategy and potential future transactions, identifying critical OT security risks that could impact valuations by 15-25% if not properly assessed.

**Key Finding:** Post-separation Exelon faces unique cybersecurity integration challenges across six regulated utilities with combined rate base of $34 billion. Hidden OT security debt and multi-state compliance complexity could add $200-400 million in unexpected remediation costs for any future acquisitions or utility consolidations.

**Tri-Partner Value:** NCC, Dragos, and Adelard's combined expertise provides comprehensive due diligence capabilities that traditional IT security assessments miss, potentially saving 30-40% on post-transaction security remediation costs.
