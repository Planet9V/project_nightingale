## **Executive Summary: Critical Threat Convergence**

*"Clean water, reliable energy, and access to healthy food for our grandchildren"* - This mission statement from Project Nightingale takes on urgent relevance as Exelon Energy, serving 10.7 million customers across six utilities, faces an unprecedented convergence of nation-state threats, escalating ransomware campaigns, and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities exposed in 2025 cyber intelligence reports.

**KEY INTELLIGENCE FINDINGS:**
- **87% increase in ransomware targeting industrial organizations** (Dragos 2025 Report)
- **Three active threat groups specifically targeting electric utilities**: ELECTRUM, VOLTZITE, and BAUXITE with direct Exelon relevance
- **94% of wireless networks lack deauthentication protection** (Nozomi Networks 2025), critical for Exelon's multi-state smart grid operations
- **30% of attacks now involve third-party compromise** (Verizon DBIR 2025), amplifying supply chain risks across Exelon's vendor ecosystem
