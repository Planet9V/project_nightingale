## RANSOM ECONOMICS

### Demand Calculation Model

**Attacker's Formula**:
```
Base: Daily revenue loss (€10M) × Expected downtime (30 days) = €300M
Plus: Customer penalty avoidance = €150M
Plus: IP theft prevention = €500M
Plus: Reputation preservation = €200M
Total Justifiable Ransom: €100M demand likely
```

### Payment Decision Framework

**Factors Supporting Payment**:
- Every day costs €10M+
- Customer relationships at stake
- IP theft prevention
- Faster recovery possible
- Insurance may cover portion

**Factors Against Payment**:
- No guarantee of recovery
- Legal and regulatory issues
- Encourages future attacks
- Reputation damage regardless
- Moral hazard created

**NXP Specific Considerations**:
- Government contracts may prohibit
- Export control implications
- Board liability concerns
- Insurance coverage limits
- Shareholder litigation risk
