2. Demonstrate OT/IT convergence expertise
3. Show integrated platform advantages
4. Prove threat intelligence superiority

#### Win Themes

**Theme 1: Semiconductor Specialization**
"Unlike generic security vendors, we understand that protecting chip designs requires different approaches than protecting emails."

**Theme 2: European Partnership**
"As a European security leader, we share your commitment to technological sovereignty and understand regional requirements."

**Theme 3: Innovation Enablement**
"Security shouldn't slow innovation - it should accelerate it by creating trusted environments for collaboration."

**Theme 4: Proven Scale**
"We protect similar environments globally and understand the complexity of your operations."

### Objection Handling Playbook

**Response Framework**:
1. Acknowledge current investments
2. Highlight semiconductor-specific gaps
3. Share threat intelligence they're missing
4. Offer complementary assessment

**Power Statement**:
"Your current security was designed for IT threats. The adversaries targeting semiconductor IP require specialized defenses that generic solutions miss."
