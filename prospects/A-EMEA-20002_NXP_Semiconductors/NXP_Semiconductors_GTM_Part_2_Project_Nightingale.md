- **Technology**: Cadence, Synopsys, Mentor Graphics EDA tools - each a potential attack vector
- **Data Flows**: Petabytes of chip designs worth billions in R&D
- **Vulnerability**: Each design center = potential €500M+ IP loss
- **Current State**: Varied security maturity across locations

**Manufacturing Operations**
- **Fab Complexity**: 200mm and 300mm wafer production facilities
- **Technology Stack**: Legacy equipment mixed with cutting-edge systems
- **Production Value**: €10M+ per day per major fab
- **Downtime Impact**: 1 day = lost customer trust + penalties
- **Security Reality**: Air-gaps compromised by Industry 4.0 initiatives

**Supply Chain Integration**
- **Scope**: 5,000+ suppliers, 123,000+ customer connections
- **Systems**: SAP, Oracle, custom APIs, B2B portals
- **Risk**: Each connection = potential infiltration point
- **Current Security**: Basic authentication, limited monitoring
- **Business Impact**: Supply chain attack = global automotive impact

#### Operational Pain Points

**1. Design Environment Vulnerabilities**
```
Current State: Distributed design teams with local security
Pain: Single compromised engineer = entire chip family exposed
Impact: €2B in automotive chip development at risk
Example: Recent "Dream Job" campaigns targeting NXP engineers
```

**2. Manufacturing Execution Risk**
```
Current State: MES systems connected for efficiency
Pain: Legacy OT systems with decades-old vulnerabilities
Impact: Recipe manipulation could cause months of bad yield
Example: Competitor faced 3-month recovery from MES compromise
```

**3. Third-Party Access Chaos**
```
Current State: Hundreds of vendor connections for maintenance
Pain: Each vendor = uncontrolled access point
Impact: Supply chain attack could halt production
Example: Industry peer suffered $100M loss via vendor compromise
```
