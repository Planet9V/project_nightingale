## EXECUTIVE COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

### The Compliance Transformation Challenge

VDL Groep faces a unprecedented regulatory transformation as it pivots from civilian manufacturing to defense production while managing 100+ autonomous divisions across 20 countries. The Born facility conversion triggers military-grade compliance requirements that cascade across the entire €4.3B enterprise, while existing obligations remain in force.

**Critical Compliance Challenges**:
- Defense: NATO standards, export controls, classified handling
- Corporate: NIS2 critical infrastructure, 100+ entity coordination
- Industry: Automotive, high-tech, and industrial standards
- Regional: 20-country regulatory matrix
- Transformation: Compliance during operational chaos

**Non-Compliance Impact**: Defense contracts void, €100M+ penalties, criminal liability
