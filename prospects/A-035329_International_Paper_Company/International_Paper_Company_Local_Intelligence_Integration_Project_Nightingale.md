## Executive Summary

International Paper Company's massive operational footprint across three continents positions them as a high-value target for the sophisticated threat actors documented in 2025 threat intelligence reports. Analysis of current threat landscapes reveals that IP's manufacturing-intensive operations, critical infrastructure designation, and ongoing DS Smith integration create a perfect storm of vulnerability to the advanced persistent threats and ransomware groups that have dramatically escalated their targeting of manufacturing sectors in 2025.

The Dragos OT Cybersecurity Report 2025 identifies that **69% of ransomware attacks targeted manufacturing entities** in 2024, with manufacturing experiencing the **highest number of ransomware cases** despite overall industry declines. IBM X-Force 2025 Threat Intelligence Index confirms that **manufacturing remains the #1-targeted industry for four years running**, with threat actors specifically focusing on operational technology disruption to maximize business impact and ransom payment pressure.

**Critical Intelligence Finding**: IP's operational profile—spanning pulp mills, paper manufacturing, and packaging operations with complex industrial control systems—directly matches the target preferences of active threat groups including BAUXITE (Iranian-backed), GRAPHITE (Russian-aligned), and VOLTZITE (Chinese state-sponsored), all of whom demonstrated Stage 2 ICS Cyber Kill Chain capabilities in 2024-2025.
