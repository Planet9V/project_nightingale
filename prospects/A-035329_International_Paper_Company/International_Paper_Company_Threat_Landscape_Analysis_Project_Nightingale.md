## Executive Summary

International Paper's global manufacturing operations and recent DS Smith acquisition create an exceptionally attractive target profile for the most sophisticated threat actors identified in 2025 intelligence reports. The company's critical infrastructure role across food, water, energy, and healthcare sectors amplifies their threat exposure exponentially, with manufacturing operations representing 69% of ransomware targets according to Dragos OT Cybersecurity Report 2025.

**Critical Threat Findings**: Active threat groups BAUXITE (Iranian-backed), GRAPHITE (Russian-aligned), and VOLTZITE (Chinese state-sponsored) demonstrate direct interest patterns matching IP's operational profile. The company's $21 billion revenue, 200+ facilities, and cross-continental DS Smith integration create multiple attack vectors for sophisticated adversaries seeking maximum operational disruption and geopolitical impact.
