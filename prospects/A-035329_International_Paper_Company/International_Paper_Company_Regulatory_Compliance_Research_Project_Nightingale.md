## Executive Summary

International Paper's global operations span multiple highly regulated industries, creating complex cybersecurity compliance requirements across food safety (FDA), environmental protection (EPA), workplace safety (OSHA), and critical infrastructure protection (DHS). The DS Smith acquisition adds European regulatory complexity including GDPR, EU Packaging Directive, and REACH chemical regulations, multiplying compliance exposure and cybersecurity requirements.

**Critical Compliance Finding**: IP's packaging operations directly impact food safety, water treatment, and healthcare supply chains, creating cascading regulatory compliance dependencies where cybersecurity failures could trigger multi-agency violations with potential penalties exceeding $200M annually across FDA, EPA, OSHA, and international jurisdictions.
