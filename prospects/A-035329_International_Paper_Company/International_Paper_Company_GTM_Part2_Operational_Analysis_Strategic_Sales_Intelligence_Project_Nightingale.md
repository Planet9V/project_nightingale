## Executive Summary

International Paper Company's $7.2 billion DS Smith acquisition has created the world's largest integrated paper and packaging operation, presenting unprecedented operational technology (OT) security challenges and the largest manufacturing cybersecurity opportunity in our pipeline. Our strategic analysis reveals critical operational vulnerabilities across their 200+ manufacturing facilities spanning three continents, with significant security gaps emerging from the massive system integration process currently underway.

The company's aggressive "80/20" transformation strategy, targeting $500M+ in annual synergies, is driving rapid operational changes that create substantial cybersecurity blind spots in their critical manufacturing infrastructure. With 69% of ransomware attacks in 2024 targeting manufacturing entities (Dragos OT Cybersecurity Report 2025), IP's operational complexity makes them a prime target for sophisticated threat actors like BAUXITE, GRAPHITE, and manufacturing-focused ransomware groups.

**Strategic Sales Opportunity**: IP's $21 billion annual revenue and mission-critical operational transformation positions them as an ideal flagship customer for demonstrating the operational excellence value of our NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution across global manufacturing operations supporting the Project Nightingale mission of sustainable packaging for "clean water, reliable energy, healthy food."
