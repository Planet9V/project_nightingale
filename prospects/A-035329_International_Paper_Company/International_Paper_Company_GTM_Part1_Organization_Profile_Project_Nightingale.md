## Executive Summary

International Paper Company stands as the world's largest integrated paper and packaging company, representing a transformational opportunity for the NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution. Following their landmark $7.2 billion acquisition of DS Smith in January 2025, IP has become a global manufacturing powerhouse spanning three continents with 65,000+ employees and over 200 manufacturing facilities worldwide. This massive operational transformation creates unprecedented cybersecurity challenges across their newly integrated operational technology (OT) environment, positioning our operational excellence consulting as mission-critical to their success.

Under CEO Andy Silvernail's aggressive "80/20" transformation strategy, IP is implementing radical operational efficiency improvements while integrating complex DS Smith manufacturing systems across Europe. This integration represents one of the largest industrial OT consolidation projects in recent history, creating significant security gaps that align perfectly with our tri-partner capabilities. The company's critical infrastructure spans pulp mills, paper manufacturing, corrugated packaging production, and forest management operationsâ€”all supporting the Project Nightingale mission of "reliable energy, clean water, healthy food" through sustainable packaging solutions.

**Strategic Positioning Opportunity**: IP's $21 billion annual revenue, combined with their aggressive digital transformation and European expansion, positions them as a flagship account for demonstrating the operational excellence value of our tri-partner solution across global manufacturing operations.
