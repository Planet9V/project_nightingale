## Executive Summary

International Paper's massive manufacturing footprint and critical infrastructure role create exponential ransomware impact potential, with 2025 threat intelligence confirming manufacturing as the #1 ransomware target for four consecutive years. The company's $21 billion revenue operations spanning 200+ facilities across three continents amplify potential ransom demands and operational disruption costs to unprecedented levels, with single incidents potentially exceeding $100M in combined impact.

**Critical Risk Assessment**: IP's operational profile—pulp mills with explosive hazard potential, food packaging affecting public safety, and just-in-time customer dependencies—creates maximum pressure scenarios that ransomware groups specifically target for payment assurance. The ongoing DS Smith integration creates additional vulnerability windows and attack surface expansion that sophisticated ransomware operators actively exploit.
