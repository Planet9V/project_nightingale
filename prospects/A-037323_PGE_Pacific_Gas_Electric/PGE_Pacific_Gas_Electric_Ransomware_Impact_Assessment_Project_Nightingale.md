## Executive Summary

For PG&E, operating under federal criminal probation for wildfire-related fatalities, ransomware represents an existential threat extending far beyond financial loss to potential corporate dissolution. A successful ransomware attack during wildfire season could trigger federal probation violations, create catastrophic public safety consequences, and expose PG&E to $10-50 billion in additional wildfire liability.

This assessment reveals that PG&E faces unique ransomware risks due to its federal oversight status, wildfire liability exposure, and critical role in California's infrastructure. Threat actors specifically target utilities during wildfire season, understanding that operational pressure and public safety concerns maximize payment likelihood and ransom demands.

**Critical Impact Findings**:
- Operational downtime costs of $2.5-5M per hour during peak demand periods
- Wildfire ignition risk from compromised safety systems could trigger $10-50B liability
- Federal probation violation potential creating corporate dissolution risk
- 73% utility ransomware payment rate drives continued criminal targeting
