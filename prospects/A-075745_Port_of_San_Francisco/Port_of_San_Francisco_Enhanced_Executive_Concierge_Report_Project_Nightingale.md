## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Why This Report Matters Now

The Port of San Francisco faces a perfect storm: ransomware attacks devastating ports globally with $500M+ losses¹, the Port of Seattle paralyzed for weeks by Rhysida ransomware², and new USCG cybersecurity mandates effective January 2025³ that you must comply with. Your legacy OT systems⁴ managing 7.5-mile waterfront⁵, 550+ commercial properties⁶, and critical supply chain operations⁷ create vulnerabilities that attackers are actively exploiting.

**Critical Context**: As the gateway for Northern California's supply chain, the Port's operational security directly impacts Project Nightingale's mission of ensuring clean water through protected maritime infrastructure, reliable energy through secure shore power systems, and healthy food through uninterrupted cargo operations.
