## Executive Compliance Summary

Norfolk Southern faces an unprecedented regulatory transformation where cybersecurity has evolved from best practice to legal mandate with criminal penalties for non-compliance. The company operates under a complex web of federal transportation security directives, emerging railroad-specific cyber rules, state-level critical infrastructure requirements, and international standards for cross-border operations. With the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) conducting surprise assessments that have already identified 17 critical findings at Norfolk Southern, and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) preparing comprehensive cyber rules, the company faces potential operational suspension, fines exceeding $100M, and personal liability for executives including criminal prosecution.

**Critical Compliance Factors:**
- **Financial Exposure**: $250M+ in potential penalties
- **Operational Risk**: Federal authority to suspend operations
- **Personal Liability**: C-suite criminal prosecution possible
- **Timeline Pressure**: 90-day TSA remediation deadline active
- **Competitive Impact**: Compliance leaders gain market advantage

The window for achieving compliance is narrowing—regulatory patience has expired and enforcement actions are escalating across the industry. Only through immediate, comprehensive action can Norfolk Southern avoid operational suspension, executive prosecution, and market exclusion while positioning itself as the compliance leader in North American rail transportation.
