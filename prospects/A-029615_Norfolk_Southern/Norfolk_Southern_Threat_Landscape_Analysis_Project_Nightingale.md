**Critical Executive Message**: Norfolk Southern faces active, sophisticated threats from nation-states, criminals, and activists who view the company's critical infrastructure as a high-value target for achieving their various objectives. The convergence of these threats with current security gaps creates an existential risk that goes beyond business disruption to potential loss of life and national security implications. The window for proactive defense is narrowing rapidly—threat actors are aware of Norfolk Southern's vulnerabilities and are actively planning exploitation. Only through immediate, comprehensive security transformation can Norfolk Southern protect its operations, employees, customers, and critical role in American supply chains.
