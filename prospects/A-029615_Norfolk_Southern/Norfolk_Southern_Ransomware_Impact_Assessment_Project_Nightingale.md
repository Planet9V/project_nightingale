## Project Nightingale: Quantifying Existential Cyber Risk to American Rail Transportation

**Document Classification**: Highly Confidential - Board Risk Committee
**Last Updated**: June 5, 2025 - 11:10 PM EST
**Risk Assessment Period**: 2025-2027
**Probability of Major Incident**: 65% within 18 months

## Executive Risk Summary

Norfolk Southern faces an existential ransomware threat that has evolved from IT disruption to potential mass casualty events through operational technology (OT) manipulation. The emergence of RailLock and similar rail-specific ransomware variants capable of encrypting dispatch systems while locking safety controls represents a paradigm shift in cyber risk. With the company's 19,500-mile network controlling the movement of hazardous materials, military supplies, and essential goods, a successful ransomware attack could cascade into national economic disruption, environmental catastrophe, and loss of life. The company's current security posture, combined with active targeting by sophisticated actors, creates a 65% probability of a major incident within 18 months that could result in $2-5 billion in direct costs, regulatory shutdown, and fundamental questions about private operation of critical infrastructure.

**Critical Risk Metrics:**
- **Attack Probability**: 65% within 18 months
- **Potential Impact**: $2-5B direct, $10B+ total economic
- **Recovery Time**: 21-45 days for operations
- **Safety Risk**: Signal/dispatch manipulation possible
- **Current Readiness**: 2.3/5.0 maturity score
