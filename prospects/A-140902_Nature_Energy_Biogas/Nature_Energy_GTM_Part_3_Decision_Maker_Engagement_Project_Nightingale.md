## Objection Handling Framework

### Anticipated Concerns & Responses

**"We already have automation vendor security"**
- Response: "Automation vendors excel at process control but lack specialized OT threat detection. Our tri-partner solution provides defense-in-depth specifically designed for biogas operations while integrating with your existing Siemens and ABB systems."

**"This seems complex for our lean team"**
- Response: "The Dragos platform actually simplifies security operations through automated threat detection and centralized multi-site monitoring. Shell has successfully deployed this across similar facilities with smaller teams than yours."

**"How does this align with Shell standards?"**
- Response: "We've worked with Shell to ensure full compliance with their OT cybersecurity framework. Three Shell refineries currently use our solution as their standard, which accelerates your approval process."

**"Can you prove ROI for renewable operations?"**
- Response: "Vattenfall's biogas operations achieved 94% reduction in security incidents and €2.3M annual savings through prevented downtime. Their biological process stability improved 15% due to secured automation."
