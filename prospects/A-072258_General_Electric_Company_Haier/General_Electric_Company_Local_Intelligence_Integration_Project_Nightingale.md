### Conclusion

The 2025 threat landscape represents an inflection point for aerospace cybersecurity. Nation-state actors have moved from opportunistic attacks to targeted campaigns against specific technologies and capabilities that GE Aerospace possesses. The convergence of IT/OT systems, digital transformation initiatives, and increasing supply chain complexity creates an attack surface that traditional security approaches cannot adequately protect.

GE Aerospace's position as the industry leader with 70,000+ engines in service makes it the highest-value target for adversaries seeking to disrupt global aviation or steal revolutionary propulsion technology. The intelligence clearly indicates that VOLTZITE, BAUXITE, and GRAPHITE have both the capability and intent to compromise GE Aerospace's critical systems.

The NCC Group tri-partner solution, incorporating Dragos's OT-specific threat intelligence, Adelard's safety-critical expertise, and NCC OTCE's offensive validation, provides the only comprehensive defense against these advanced persistent threats. Time is of the essence - with adversaries already achieving 287-day dwell times, every day without proper protection increases the likelihood of catastrophic compromise.

**The future of flight depends on securing it today.**
