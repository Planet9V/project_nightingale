### Conclusion

The threat landscape facing GE Aerospace represents the convergence of nation-state capabilities, criminal innovation, and sector-specific vulnerabilities. VOLTZITE, BAUXITE, and GRAPHITE have demonstrated both the intent and capability to compromise GE Aerospace's most critical assets, from revolutionary propulsion technology to the vast installed engine base.

The evolution from opportunistic attacks to targeted campaigns against specific aerospace capabilities marks a fundamental shift requiring equally transformational defense. Traditional security approaches have failed, as evidenced by 287-day dwell times and successful compromises across the sector.

GE Aerospace's position as industry leader makes it the highest-priority target for adversaries seeking to steal decades of innovation or disrupt global aviation. The company's $140B order backlog, revolutionary RISE program, and critical defense platforms create an attack surface that demands comprehensive protection.

The NCC Group tri-partner solution provides the only defense matching the sophistication of these threats. Combining Dragos's OT-specific threat intelligence, Adelard's safety-critical expertise, and NCC OTCE's offensive validation creates a defensive posture capable of detecting, preventing, and responding to the most advanced threat actors.

The cost of inaction is catastrophic - from fleet groundings to stolen innovation that could eliminate GE Aerospace's competitive advantage. The time for incremental security improvements has passed. Only transformational security can protect transformational innovation in the face of existential cyber threats.
