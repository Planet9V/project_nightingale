# General Electric Company (GE Aerospace) - Regulatory Compliance Research
## Project Nightingale: Navigating the Complex Aerospace Compliance Landscape

### Executive Summary

GE Aerospace faces an increasingly complex regulatory environment with overlapping cybersecurity requirements across its global operations spanning 24 countries. The convergence of defense contracts requiring CMMC Level 3 certification, European NIS2 Directive enforcement, and emerging aviation-specific cybersecurity mandates creates a compliance burden estimated at $75M over 18 months. With 127 NIST 800-171 controls currently non-compliant and October 2025 CMMC enforcement looming, GE Aerospace risks losing access to $5B in defense contracts while facing potential fines up to €10M or 2% of global revenue under EU regulations. This comprehensive analysis maps the regulatory landscape, identifies critical gaps, and provides a strategic roadmap for achieving and maintaining compliance while transforming regulatory requirements into competitive advantages.

### Conclusion

GE Aerospace stands at a critical regulatory crossroads where compliance has evolved from checkbox exercise to strategic imperative. The convergence of defense, aviation, and international cybersecurity regulations creates unprecedented complexity requiring transformational approaches to compliance management.

The financial stakes are enormous - $5B in defense contracts depend on CMMC compliance, while EU operations face potential fines of €10M or 2% of global revenue. Beyond financial risks, non-compliance threatens market access, competitive position, and customer relationships in an industry where trust and reliability are paramount.

Current compliance gaps, particularly the 127 non-compliant NIST 800-171 controls and limited NIS2 readiness, require immediate attention. The October 2025 CMMC deadline and January 2025 NIS2 enforcement create urgency that cannot be ignored.

The NCC Group tri-partner solution provides comprehensive compliance expertise combining regulatory knowledge, technical implementation, and continuous validation capabilities. Our approach transforms compliance from burden to competitive advantage, enabling GE Aerospace to exceed requirements while building resilient security architecture.

The investment required - approximately $105M over 24 months - pales in comparison to the risks of non-compliance. More importantly, this investment creates lasting value through improved security posture, operational efficiency, and market differentiation.

The time for action is now. Every day of delay increases compliance debt and regulatory risk. GE Aerospace must move decisively to build a world-class compliance program that protects current business while enabling future growth. The tri-partner solution provides the expertise, technology, and methodology to achieve this transformation efficiently and effectively.
