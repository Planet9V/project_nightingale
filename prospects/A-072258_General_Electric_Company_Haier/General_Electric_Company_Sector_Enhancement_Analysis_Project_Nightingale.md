### Conclusion

The aerospace manufacturing sector stands at a critical juncture where cybersecurity has evolved from IT concern to existential business imperative. GE Aerospace's position as industry leader with 70,000+ engines in service makes it both the highest-value target and the company with most to lose from inadequate security.

The sector-wide evolution shows clear patterns: threat actors have moved from opportunistic attacks to targeted campaigns against specific aerospace capabilities. The January 2025 Safran compromise and recent supply chain infiltrations demonstrate that no aerospace manufacturer is immune. With regulatory requirements tightening and customer demands increasing, security investment is no longer optional but mandatory for market participation.

GE Aerospace's current security posture, with spending at 7% of IT budget compared to industry leaders at 15-18%, creates dangerous exposure gaps that sophisticated adversaries actively exploit. The 287-day average dwell time in aerospace OT environments means threats likely already exist within GE's infrastructure.

The NCC Group tri-partner solution provides the only comprehensive approach combining aerospace-specific threat intelligence (Dragos), safety-critical system expertise (Adelard), and elite offensive validation (NCC OTCE). This unique combination addresses the sector's specific challenges while enabling GE Aerospace to transform security from cost center to competitive advantage.

The time for action is now. Every day of delay increases the probability of catastrophic compromise that could ground fleets, destroy decades of innovation, and cripple GE Aerospace's market position. The future of flight depends on securing it today.
