# General Electric Company (GE Aerospace) - GTM Part 3: Decision-Maker Profiles & Engagement Strategy
## Project Nightingale

### Executive Summary

GE Aerospace's leadership structure reflects a unique post-transformation dynamic where security, technology, and operational excellence converge under unified executive oversight. The absence of a dedicated CISO role, with security reporting through General Counsel Jake Phillips, creates both challenges and opportunities for comprehensive security transformation. With Larry Culp's proven track record of 400% market cap growth and Mohamed Ali's oversight of $2.3B R&D investment, the executive team demonstrates strong capability for transformational initiatives. The 2025 threat landscape, showing 340% increased targeting of aerospace manufacturers by nation-state actors, demands executive-level security engagement that aligns with GE Aerospace's "FLIGHT DECK" operational philosophy and innovation mandate.

### Section 8: Risk Mitigation & Objection Handling

#### Anticipated Objections & Responses

**"We're already working with Microsoft/AWS for security"**
- Response: "Cloud provider security protects their infrastructure, not your unique OT environment and aerospace IP. We integrate with and enhance your existing investments."

**"Security slows down innovation"**
- Response: "Our embedded security approach accelerates development by preventing the 6-month delays typical of post-breach remediation. Ask Airbus about their 2024 experience."

**"Budget is allocated to manufacturing expansion"**
- Response: "A single OT incident costs $45M and 3 weeks of production. Our solution pays for itself by preventing just one incident while protecting your $1B manufacturing investment."

**"We need to focus on commercial execution"**
- Response: "Your airlines customers increasingly require security certifications. United Airlines now mandates supplier security audits - we ensure you exceed their requirements."

#### Political Landmines to Navigate

1. **Legacy GE Security Failures**: Acknowledge transformation without dwelling
2. **Boeing Comparison**: Position as opportunity to lead, not follow
3. **Defense vs Commercial**: Emphasize unified platform benefits
4. **Engineering Autonomy**: Frame as enabling, not controlling
5. **Cost Pressures**: Focus on risk reduction and ROI

### Conclusion & Next Steps

GE Aerospace's executive team stands at a critical decision point where transformational leadership meets existential cyber threats. The absence of dedicated security leadership creates an opportunity for NCC Group to fill a strategic void while the post-spin-off momentum enables decisive action. With Larry Culp's proven ability to drive 400% value creation and the executive team's combined oversight of $38.7B in revenue, the capacity for transformational security investment exists.

The convergence of mounting nation-state threats, customer security requirements, and regulatory mandates creates a compelling burning platform. By engaging through multiple stakeholders while building toward CEO-level sponsorship, NCC Group can position security as an enabler of GE Aerospace's ambitious growth agenda rather than a constraint on innovation.

**Immediate Action Items**:
1. Schedule technical deep-dive with David Burns (CIO)
2. Arrange compliance assessment with Amy Gowder (Defense)
3. Develop FLIGHT DECK-aligned security metrics
4. Create aerospace threat intelligence briefing
5. Prepare executive dashboard prototype

The window for transformational security at GE Aerospace is open but time-limited. The tri-partner solution's unique combination of aerospace expertise, OT specialization, and proven value delivery positions NCC Group as the only partner capable of securing GE Aerospace's journey to invent the future of flight.
