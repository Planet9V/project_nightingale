# General Electric Company (GE Aerospace) - Ransomware Impact Assessment
## Project Nightingale: Critical Analysis of Ransomware Threats to Global Aviation

### Executive Summary

GE Aerospace faces unprecedented ransomware risks with potential impacts exceeding $2.4B across operational disruption, intellectual property theft, and regulatory penalties. The aerospace sector experienced a 340% increase in ransomware attacks in 2024-2025, with average demands reaching $47M and production impacts extending 21-45 days. GE Aerospace's unique vulnerabilities stem from its 70,000+ engine installed base creating fleet-wide risks, 24-country manufacturing footprint expanding attack surface, and critical dependencies where single facility compromises can halt global production. Recent attacks on competitors Safran (January 2025) and IHI Corporation (February 2025) demonstrate threat actors' specific targeting of engine manufacturers. With LockBit 4.0's aerospace specialization program and BAUXITE's ransomware partnerships, GE Aerospace must transform its defensive posture from reactive recovery to proactive resilience.

### Conclusion

Ransomware represents an existential threat to GE Aerospace's operations, with potential impacts exceeding $2.4B in the most severe scenarios. The convergence of sophisticated threat actors, aerospace-specific targeting, and GE's critical infrastructure dependencies creates a perfect storm of risk that demands immediate and comprehensive action.

The current security posture, with 62% of facilities lacking proper segmentation and 38% of critical systems without offline backups, is wholly inadequate against modern ransomware operations. The 287-day average dwell time means attackers likely already exist within GE's infrastructure, positioning for maximum impact.

Recent attacks on Safran and IHI Corporation provide clear warning of threat actors' capabilities and intent. GE Aerospace's position as the industry leader with 70,000+ engines in service makes it the ultimate target for groups seeking maximum disruption and profit.

The financial mathematics are compelling - investing $100M in comprehensive ransomware defense over 3 years prevents potential losses of $2.4B while protecting market position, customer relationships, and decades of innovation. More critically, this investment transforms GE Aerospace from reactive victim to resilient leader, creating competitive advantage through superior security.

The NCC Group tri-partner solution provides the specialized expertise required: NCC OTCE simulates advanced ransomware attacks, Dragos provides OT-specific threat intelligence and monitoring, while Adelard ensures safety-critical systems remain secure and recoverable. This comprehensive approach is the only path to achieving true ransomware resilience.

The time for half-measures has passed. Every day without comprehensive ransomware defense increases the probability of catastrophic attack. GE Aerospace must act decisively to protect its future - the cost of prevention pales compared to the price of recovery.
