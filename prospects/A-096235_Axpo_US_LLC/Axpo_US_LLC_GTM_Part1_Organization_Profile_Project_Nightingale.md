## Executive Summary

Axpo U.S. LLC represents a strategic expansion of Swiss energy giant Axpo Group into the North American energy trading and renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) markets. Operating from dual command centers in New York (financial hub) and Houston (operational hub), Axpo U.S. leverages over â‚¬7 billion in parent company resources to structure complex energy solutions in ERCOT, PJM, and MISO markets.

The organization demonstrates sophisticated risk management capabilities through its April 2025 Danfoss PPA - a landmark agreement supplying renewable energy to 24 factories and 36 U.S. locations through 2032. This operational complexity, combined with Axpo Group's December 2024 launch of the first OT Security Operations Center with SCION connectivity in Europe, reveals an organization at the convergence of advanced energy trading, renewable integration, and critical infrastructure security.

**Key Strategic Insight**: Axpo U.S. operates as the North American operational arm of a European energy leader that has already invested heavily in operational technology security, creating a unique opportunity for tri-partner solution deployment supporting "reliable energy" operations critical to Project Nightingale's mission.
