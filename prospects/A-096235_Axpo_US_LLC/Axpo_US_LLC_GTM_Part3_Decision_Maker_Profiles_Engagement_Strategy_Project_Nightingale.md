## Executive Summary

Axpo U.S. LLC's decision-making architecture reflects a sophisticated balance between local U.S. operational autonomy and strategic oversight from European parent company leadership. The organization's recent success with the Danfoss PPA demonstrates strong local execution capability while leveraging parent company resources, creating multiple engagement opportunities across both U.S. and European leadership levels.

The decision-making matrix reveals a unique opportunity: U.S. leadership (Kamal Khoury) drives operational initiatives while European executives (Henriette Wendt, Jacopo Fumagalli) control technology investments and security frameworks. This structure, combined with Axpo Group's December 2024 OT Security Operations Center launch, creates an exceptional foundation for positioning operational excellence solutions that bridge local U.S. renewable energy operations with European operational technology security leadership.

**Strategic Engagement Insight**: Success requires a dual-track approach - engaging U.S. leadership for operational needs assessment while simultaneously aligning with European executives for strategic technology and security framework decisions that support Project Nightingale's "reliable energy" mission.
