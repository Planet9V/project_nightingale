However, enterprise-wide cybersecurity, supply chain protection, and operational technology security are distinct and equally critical domains. Our services complement your product certification by securing the entire ecosystem that develops, manufactures, and deploys AirWarden™."

**"Our small team can handle security internally"**
*Response:* "Your team's technical expertise is impressive, particularly in RF engineering. However, the breadth of modern cyber threats - from nation-state actors to supply chain attacks - often requires specialized, dedicated expertise across multiple domains. We can augment your team's capabilities without the overhead of full-time hires."

**"Security investments don't directly generate revenue"**
*Response:* "Security can be a powerful revenue driver in the critical infrastructure market. Customers increasingly select vendors based on security posture. A transparent, industry-leading security program becomes a competitive differentiator that justifies premium pricing and builds customer confidence."

**"We need to focus resources on product development"**
