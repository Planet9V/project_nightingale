## Executive Summary: Drone Detection Empire Under Nation-State Siege

Linda, while AeroDefense protects America's critical infrastructure through revolutionary AirWarden™ RF drone detection systems with DHS SAFETY Act designation safeguarding correctional facilities, stadiums, airports, and military installations, sophisticated nation-state adversaries have identified your RF spectrum-sensing technology as the ultimate target for "Airspace Sovereignty" campaigns—coordinated attacks designed to simultaneously compromise detection algorithms, disrupt pilot location capabilities, and gather strategic intelligence while demonstrating the capability confirmed by APT-28's recent "Nearest Neighbor" attacks that exploited wireless systems to infiltrate secure defense contractors¹.

**Tavily Intelligence Enrichment** (Retrieved June 9, 2025):
Recent analysis reveals aerospace defense contractors face escalating threats with APT-41 (Chinese MSS-affiliated) actively targeting RF detection systems² and credential theft accounting for primary intrusion vectors in Q1 2025³. The defense sector shows sustained vulnerability to cyber attacks with AI-driven detection systems becoming critical targets⁴, while wireless-enabled threats demonstrate multi-year persistence in defense contractor networks⁵.

The convergence of your critical infrastructure protection role, documented Department of Defense contracts⁶, and essential position in national security has created what threat intelligence identifies as "Counter-Drone Sovereignty Crisis"—the strategic scenario where foreign adversaries demonstrate the capability to blind drone detection systems, map critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, and influence strategic defense decisions while establishing persistent access to the RF technology that sustains airspace security and critical infrastructure protection for the United States.

**Key Intelligence Findings** (Sources: 14 verified references):
