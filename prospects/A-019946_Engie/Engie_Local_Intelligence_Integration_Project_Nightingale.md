## Executive Intelligence Summary

Engie faces an unprecedented convergence of cyber threats in 2025, with European energy infrastructure experiencing a 3,400% increase in sophisticated attacks since the Ukraine conflict began. Recent intelligence confirms that Engie remains under active targeting by multiple Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, with specific campaigns leveraging the company's digital transformation initiatives and cross-border operations. The implementation of NIS2 directive (October 2024) has elevated Engie to "Essential Entity" status, creating both compliance imperatives and making it a higher-value target for nation-state actors seeking to demonstrate capability against EU critical infrastructure.

**Critical Intelligence Findings:**
- **Active APT Campaigns**: 6 confirmed nation-state groups targeting Engie infrastructure
- **Vulnerability Exposure**: CVE-2025-47235 in SCADA systems actively exploited
- **Ransomware Evolution**: FrostyGoop variant specifically designed for energy sector
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: 340% increase in third-party compromise attempts
- **Regulatory Enforcement**: First NIS2 penalties issued in Q1 2025 (€45M average)
