## Executive Summary

Engie's position as Europe's energy transition leader creates both exceptional opportunity and existential risk in the current geopolitical cyber warfare environment. With €73.8 billion in revenue and critical infrastructure spanning nuclear, gas, and renewable generation across 70+ countries, Engie faces unprecedented targeting from nation-state actors seeking to destabilize European energy supplies. The August 2023 breach, combined with NIS2 compliance deadlines and aggressive digital transformation initiatives, creates a perfect storm requiring immediate, comprehensive security transformation. The company's financial capacity (€5.5B net income) and strategic commitment to Net Zero by 2045 provide both the means and motivation for world-class cybersecurity investment.

**Critical Business Drivers:**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: €3B+ penalty exposure under NIS2, GDPR, and French LPM
- **Operational Resilience**: 106.7 GW generation capacity at risk from cyber-physical attacks
- **Financial Protection**: €73.8B revenue dependent on operational continuity
- **Strategic Enablement**: €13-15B renewable investment requires secure digital foundation
- **Geopolitical Defense**: European energy security depends on Engie's resilience
