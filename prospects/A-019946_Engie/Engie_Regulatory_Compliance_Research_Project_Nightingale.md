## Executive Compliance Summary

Engie operates in the most complex regulatory environment in global energy, with cybersecurity compliance requirements spanning 70+ jurisdictions and involving 200+ specific regulations. The implementation of NIS2 in October 2024 fundamentally transformed the compliance landscape, elevating cybersecurity from technical requirement to board-level fiduciary duty with personal liability. With €3.45 billion in potential penalties and the possibility of operational suspension, regulatory compliance has become an existential business issue that can either cripple Engie's operations or provide competitive advantage through security leadership.

**Critical Compliance Factors:**
- **Financial Exposure**: €3.45B in aggregate penalty risk
- **Personal Liability**: CEO and board members face criminal prosecution
- **Operational Risk**: License revocation and suspension powers activated
- **Market Impact**: Non-compliance equals market exclusion
- **Opportunity**: First-movers gain preferred supplier status
