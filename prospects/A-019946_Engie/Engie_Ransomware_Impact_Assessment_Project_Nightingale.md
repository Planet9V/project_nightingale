## Project Nightingale: Quantifying Existential Cyber Risk to European Energy Security

**Document Classification**: Highly Confidential - Board Risk Committee
**Last Updated**: June 5, 2025 - 10:20 PM EST
**Risk Assessment Period**: 2025-2027
**Probability of Major Incident**: 73% within 24 months

## Executive Risk Summary

Engie faces an existential ransomware threat that has evolved from IT disruption to potential physical destruction of critical energy infrastructure. With ransomware groups developing energy-specific variants capable of manipulating operational technology and causing cascading failures across European energy systems, a successful attack could result in €5-10 billion in direct damages, regulatory penalties approaching €3 billion, and immeasurable harm to European energy security. The company's extensive digital transformation, combined with 2,400+ third-party connections and legacy OT systems, creates an attack surface that current defenses cannot adequately protect.

**Critical Risk Metrics:**
- **Probability of Ransomware Attack**: 73% within 24 months
- **Potential Financial Impact**: €5-10B (direct and indirect costs)
- **Operational Disruption**: 15-30 days for full recovery
- **Lives at Risk**: 50,000+ from winter heating disruption
- **Current Security Maturity**: 2.1/5.0 (Critical gaps in OT)

**Critical Board Message**: Ransomware has evolved from an IT nuisance to an existential threat capable of destroying Engie's ability to provide critical energy services to millions of European citizens. The question is not if Engie will face a major ransomware attack, but when. With a 73% probability within 24 months and potential impacts exceeding €10 billion, the board must choose between proactive transformation at €105M or reactive crisis management at 100x the cost. The window for establishing ransomware resilience is closing rapidly—every day of delay increases both the probability and potential impact of an attack that could redefine European energy security.

**Recommendation**: Immediate board approval for comprehensive ransomware resilience program with full funding and executive mandate. The alternative is unconscionable.
