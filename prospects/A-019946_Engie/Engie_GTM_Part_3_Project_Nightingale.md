---

## Executive Summary

Engie's leadership team combines strong technical expertise with ambitious energy transition goals, creating both compelling drivers and complex dynamics for cybersecurity transformation. CEO Catherine MacGregor's industrial background and focus on operational excellence, combined with the French state's 23.64% ownership stake, ensures security investments align with national energy security priorities. However, the aggressive Net Zero timeline and €13-15B renewable investment program create competing priorities that require careful navigation. The August 2023 breach and increasing regulatory pressure provide immediate catalysts for executive action.

**Key Engagement Insights:**
- **CEO MacGregor**: Industrial engineer focused on operational resilience and European energy independence
- **CFO Riolacci**: Former Veolia executive balancing growth investment with risk management
- **Digital Leadership Gap**: Recent digital transformation leadership changes create opportunity
- **Board Oversight**: Jean-Pierre Clamadieu's chemical industry background brings risk awareness
- **State Influence**: French government representation ensures national security alignment
