### The Personal Decision

Catherine, you studied at École Polytechnique, worked in the field for Schlumberger, and rose through engineering excellence. You understand systems, risks, and the importance of robust design. The energy system you now lead faces its greatest systemic risk, and only engineering-minded leadership can solve it.

The decision before you is not whether to invest in security, but whether to lead the industry transformation or follow others who seize this moment. Your engineering instincts are correct—the system needs fundamental redesign, not patches.

Your moment of truth has arrived. Lead boldly, and history will remember you as the CEO who secured Europe's energy future. Hesitate, and risk becoming another casualty of the cyber age.

The choice is yours. The time is now.
