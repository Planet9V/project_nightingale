## Executive Compliance Summary

Crestron Electronics faces an unprecedented regulatory transformation as building automation systems become subject to stringent cybersecurity mandates across federal, state, and industry-specific frameworks. The convergence of IT/OT regulations, critical infrastructure protection requirements, and emerging building-specific security standards creates immediate compliance obligations with significant financial penalties and market access implications. Crestron's current lack of security certifications and absence of compliance leadership poses existential risks to government contracts and regulated sector sales.

**Critical Compliance Gaps:**
- **Zero security certifications** for building automation products
- **No FedRAMP authorization** blocking federal cloud deployments
- **Missing NERC CIP compliance** for utility sector customers
- **EPA violations pending** for water sector implementations
- **$45M potential penalties** across current non-compliance areas

## 10. Compliance Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Gap Closure (0-90 days)
1. Hire Chief Compliance Officer
2. Conduct comprehensive gap assessment
3. Implement emergency controls
4. Begin FedRAMP process
5. Address CVE-2025-47419

### Phase 2: Certification Sprint (90-180 days)
1. NERC CIP registration
2. UL 2900 testing initiation
3. ISO 27001 implementation
4. State compliance programs
5. Supply chain documentation

### Phase 3: Market Leadership (180-365 days)
1. Achieve key certifications
2. Implement advanced controls
3. Industry leadership position
4. Compliance automation
5. Customer enablement

**Critical Decision Point**: Without immediate compliance investment, Crestron faces exclusion from 60% of its addressable market and potential criminal liability for executives. The window for proactive compliance is rapidly closing as enforcement deadlines approach and competitors achieve certifications.
