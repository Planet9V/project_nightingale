## Personal Message to Dan Feldstein

Dan,

Your father built Crestron into an industry icon through innovation, quality, and unwavering commitment to customer success. Today, that legacy faces its greatest threat—not from competitors or market forces, but from cyber adversaries targeting the very building systems that Crestron pioneered. This report provides a candid assessment and clear path forward to not only protect what George built, but to position Crestron for another 50 years of leadership.

The decisions you make in the next 90 days will determine whether Crestron's name remains synonymous with excellence or becomes a cautionary tale of cybersecurity failure. The time for action is now.

### Your Father's Question

George would ask: "Are we solving the real problem for our customers?"

Today, that problem is security. Your customers need Crestron to lead them safely into the future. They're counting on you to protect their operations, their people, and their missions.

### The Decision

Dan, you have 90 days to set Crestron's trajectory for the next decade. The choice is yours: Lead the transformation that secures your father's legacy and builds the next chapter of Crestron's success, or watch as cyber threats destroy what took 50 years to build.

The board, your employees, your customers, and your family are watching. More importantly, history will judge whether you rose to meet this challenge or let Crestron become another casualty of the cyber war.

The time for decision is now. Your legacy—and your father's—depends on it.
