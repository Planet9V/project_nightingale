# Crestron Electronics: GTM Part 3 - Decision-Maker Profiles & Engagement Strategy
## Project Nightingale: Executive Leadership Alignment for Security Transformation

**Document Classification**: Confidential - Executive Intelligence
**Last Updated**: June 5, 2025
**Account ID**: A-078866
**Engagement Priority**: Critical - Immediate Security Leadership Gap

---

## Executive Summary

Crestron Electronics' leadership structure reveals critical gaps in security governance that create both vulnerability and opportunity for strategic engagement. The absence of a Chief Information Security Officer, recent departure of COO Dan Brady, and lack of security representation at the executive level indicate an organization unprepared for the escalating cyber threats targeting building automation systems. With CEO Dan Feldstein protecting his father's legacy while facing unprecedented security challenges, the leadership team requires immediate support to transform security from operational liability into competitive advantage.

**Key Engagement Insights:**
- **Family Legacy Pressure**: Dan Feldstein personally invested in protecting 50-year company reputation
- **Revenue Protection Focus**: CSO John Clancy witnessing security-related sales losses
- **Technical Debt Reality**: CIO Sherwood King overwhelmed by IT/OT convergence risks
- **Leadership Vacuum**: No security executive to champion transformation
