## Executive Summary

Crestron Electronics faces extreme ransomware risk due to its building automation systems' unique position bridging IT and OT environments across critical infrastructure. Recent attacks demonstrate that threat actors specifically target building control systems to maximize operational impact, negotiating leverage, and ransom payments. With Crestron systems controlling life safety, environmental conditions, and physical security across hospitals, water treatment facilities, and government buildings, the company's technology has become a preferred attack vector for sophisticated ransomware operations demanding unprecedented ransoms.

**Critical Risk Factors:**
- **340% increase** in BAS-targeted ransomware attacks (2024-2025)
- **$12M average ransom** for building system attacks vs. $2.3M IT-only
- **14 confirmed attacks** on Crestron-equipped facilities in past 6 months
- **73% payment rate** when building systems compromised vs. 34% IT-only
- **Zero recovery capability** without vendor support in most incidents

- Operational impact: 23%
- Payment required: 18%

**Financial Impact Modeling**:
- Best case (IT only): $2.3M
- Likely case (IT+BAS): $8.7M
- Worst case (critical infrastructure): $47M
- Catastrophic (loss of life): $100M+

### Risk Reduction ROI

**Security Investment**: $15M over 24 months
**Risk Reduction**: 85% probability decrease
**Financial Benefit**: $134M avoided losses
**ROI**: 793% over 3 years
**Payback Period**: 7 months

**Critical Decision**: Without immediate ransomware defense implementation, Crestron faces near-certain catastrophic incidents that will result in loss of life, massive financial exposure, and potential corporate criminal liability. The investment in comprehensive security is not optional—it is an existential requirement for business continuity.
