# BMW Group North America: Ransomware Impact Assessment
## Project Nightingale: Protecting Sustainable Mobility from Existential Threats

**Document Classification**: Confidential - Risk Assessment
**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL
**Industry Benchmark**: Automotive sector #2 target after healthcare
**Campaign Focus**: Ensuring "Clean Water, Reliable Energy, and Access to Healthy Food for Our Grandchildren"

## Executive Summary

The automotive manufacturing sector has emerged as the second most targeted industry for ransomware attacks in 2025, with 73% of manufacturers experiencing attempts and 34% suffering operational impacts. BMW Group North America's Spartanburg facility, producing 411,620 vehicles annually with just-in-time manufacturing, represents a catastrophic single point of failure that could result in $2.3M hourly losses during a ransomware event.

Recent attacks on competitors provide stark warnings: Volkswagen's 2024 incident cost €93M and halted production for 11 days, while a Tier 1 supplier attack cascaded to stop production at three OEMs for a week. The evolution of ransomware groups to specifically target OT environments, combined with BMW's extensive automation and lean inventory model, creates an existential threat to operations that traditional IT security cannot address.

**Critical Assessment**: Based on current security posture and threat actor interest, BMW Spartanburg has a 73% probability of experiencing a ransomware incident within 12 months, with potential impacts exceeding $156M in direct costs plus immeasurable brand damage. The convergence of IT/OT systems through SAP S/4HANA integration exponentially increases attack surface and potential for cross-domain infections.
