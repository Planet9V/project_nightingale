## Executive Summary

BMW Group North America's leadership structure reflects a sophisticated blend of German engineering excellence and American market innovation. The decision-making hierarchy involves complex interactions between Spartanburg leadership, North American executives, and Munich headquarters, requiring a nuanced engagement approach that addresses both local operational needs and global strategic alignment.

Based on 2025 industry intelligence, automotive executives are prioritizing operational resilience and sustainability over pure cost reduction, with 87% of automotive C-suite leaders identifying OT security as a board-level concern following high-profile ransomware attacks on competitors. BMW's leadership team, notably lacking dedicated OT security executives, presents both a challenge and opportunity for strategic positioning of the tri-partner solution.

**Key Insight**: The absence of a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer at BMW Manufacturing creates a unique opportunity to position the tri-partner solution as enabling the creation of this critical role while providing immediate operational value.
