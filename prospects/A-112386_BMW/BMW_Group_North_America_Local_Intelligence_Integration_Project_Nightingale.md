## Conclusion

The 2025 threat landscape presents unprecedented challenges to BMW's Spartanburg operations, with sophisticated threat actors specifically targeting automotive OT infrastructure. The convergence of nation-state capabilities, ransomware evolution, and AI-enhanced attacks requires immediate action to protect production capability critical to sustainable mobility and Project Nightingale's mission.

**Critical Actions Required**:
1. **Immediate**: Deploy Dragos platform for visibility and threat detection
2. **Near-term**: Implement tri-partner solution for comprehensive protection
3. **Strategic**: Transform to resilient, zero-trust OT architecture

**Risk Assessment**: Without immediate action, BMW Spartanburg faces a **73% probability** of experiencing a production-impacting cyber incident within 12 months, based on sector trends and specific threat actor interest. The tri-partner solution reduces this risk to under 20% while enabling operational excellence improvements aligned with BMW's sustainability goals.
