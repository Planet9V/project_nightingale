## Executive Summary

BMW Group North America faces an evolving threat landscape characterized by sophisticated nation-state actors, financially motivated cybercriminals, and ideologically driven hacktivists specifically targeting automotive manufacturing infrastructure. The Spartanburg facility's role as BMW's largest global production center, combined with its advanced automation and just-in-time manufacturing model, creates a high-value target for adversaries seeking economic disruption, intellectual property theft, and competitive advantage.

Based on 2025 threat intelligence from Dragos, CrowdStrike, and Mandiant, automotive OT environments experienced a 156% increase in targeted attacks compared to 2024. Three distinct threat actor groups - VOLTZITE, BAUXITE, and GRAPHITE - have demonstrated specific interest in BMW's technology stack and operational model. The convergence of IT/OT systems through SAP S/4HANA integration and the deployment of software-defined manufacturing create new attack surfaces requiring immediate attention.

**Critical Assessment**: Without enhanced OT security measures, BMW Spartanburg faces a 73% probability of experiencing a significant cyber incident within 12 months, with potential losses exceeding $150M from production disruption, intellectual property theft, and recovery costs.
