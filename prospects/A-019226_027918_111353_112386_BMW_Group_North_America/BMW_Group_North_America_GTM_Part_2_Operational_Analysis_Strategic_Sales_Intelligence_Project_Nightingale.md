## Executive Summary

BMW Group North America represents a critical convergence of advanced manufacturing excellence and sustainability innovation, with the Spartanburg plant serving as the largest BMW production facility globally. The organization's operational footprint encompasses sophisticated just-in-time manufacturing, extensive automation systems, and complex supply chain networks that directly impact sustainable mobility and environmental stewardship - core elements of Project Nightingale's mission.

Recent 2025 intelligence from Dragos OT Cybersecurity Report reveals that 71% of automotive manufacturers experienced OT security incidents in 2024, with production disruptions averaging 11 days per incident. BMW's Spartanburg facility, producing over 411,620 vehicles annually and supporting 20,000+ jobs, represents both a critical economic asset and a significant operational risk concentration requiring advanced OT security measures.

**Strategic Opportunity**: The convergence of BMW's digital transformation initiatives (SAP S/4HANA migration, NEUE KLASSE platform development) with identified vulnerabilities in their automation infrastructure creates an immediate $15-25M operational excellence opportunity through the tri-partner solution.
