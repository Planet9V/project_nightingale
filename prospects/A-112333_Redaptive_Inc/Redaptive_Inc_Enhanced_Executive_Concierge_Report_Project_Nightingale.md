## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Why This Report Matters Now

Redaptive faces unprecedented cyber risk convergence: your Energy-as-a-Service platform managing $98.1M revenue¹ across 353 employees² creates massive attack surface while building automation systems experience "siegeware" ransomware surge³. With portfolio-wide efficiency deployments⁴ connecting thousands of smart buildings⁵, hackers increasingly target EaaS providers to "lock building managers out of smart systems until ransom is paid"⁶. Your Honeywell Ventures and CPP Investments backing⁷ elevates visibility to sophisticated threat actors hunting energy efficiency leaders⁸. The intersection of building automation vulnerabilities⁹ and critical infrastructure targeting¹⁰ demands immediate security transformation to protect Project Nightingale's mission of ensuring reliable energy through efficient operations.

**Critical Context**: As America's leading Energy-as-a-Service provider breaking down barriers to portfolio-wide efficiency¹¹, Redaptive's operational security directly impacts thousands of commercial buildings, energy grid stability, and the sustainable infrastructure essential for future generations.
