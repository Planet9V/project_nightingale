## Executive Summary

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) stands as one of America's most critical public transit systems, serving the nation's capital and surrounding jurisdictions with an infrastructure that directly impacts federal government operations, national security, and the daily lives of 4 million residents. Operating under unprecedented security scrutiny due to its unique position transporting federal employees, diplomats, and military personnel, WMATA faces an evolving threat landscape where sophisticated adversaries view transit disruption as a strategic objective. The convergence of aging operational technology, rapid digital transformation initiatives, and the inherent vulnerabilities of a sprawling 1,500-square-mile multimodal network creates extraordinary cybersecurity challenges requiring immediate attention.

Recent intelligence confirms that state-sponsored threat actors have specifically targeted mass transit systems in major U.S. cities, with WMATA's proximity to federal facilities and critical infrastructure making it a prime target. The authority's ambitious "Your Metro, The Way Forward" strategic transformation plan, while essential for modernization, has exponentially expanded the attack surface through initiatives like contactless payment systems, AI-powered predictive maintenance, and automated train operations. With 98 Metro stations, 128 miles of track, 1,500 buses, and critical OT systems controlling everything from train signaling to tunnel ventilation, a successful cyber attack could paralyze the capital region while potentially causing mass casualties.

**Critical Infrastructure at Risk:**
- **98 Metro stations** across six lines with increasingly connected systems
- **$2.3 billion** annual operating budget supporting 250+ million trips
- **12,000+ employees** managing complex IT/OT convergence  
- **Federal nexus** creating national security implications for any disruption
- **Legacy systems** dating to 1976 operating alongside cutting-edge digital platforms
