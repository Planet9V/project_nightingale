## Executive Regulatory Summary

Southern California Edison operates within the most complex and punitive regulatory environment in the U.S. utility sector, where cybersecurity failures now trigger not just corporate fines but personal criminal prosecution of executives. The convergence of federal NERC CIP requirements, California's aggressive CPUC oversight, and emerging environmental/safety regulations linked to cyber integrity creates an unprecedented compliance landscape where a single security breach could result in executive imprisonment, multi-billion dollar liability, and potential loss of operating authority.

Recent regulatory evolution has fundamentally transformed compliance from a paperwork exercise to a technical capability requirement with real-time validation. The CPUC's groundbreaking decision to link cybersecurity directly to wildfire liability—holding utilities criminally responsible for cyber-induced safety failures—combined with NERC's expansion of CIP standards to distribution infrastructure creates compliance obligations that SCE is currently unprepared to meet. With peer utilities facing $20 million fines and executives under criminal investigation for security failures, SCE's current bottom-quartile security maturity represents an existential regulatory risk.

**Critical Regulatory Realities:**
- **NERC CIP-013**: Supply chain security enforcement began October 2024 - SCE non-compliant
- **CPUC Wildfire-Cyber Nexus**: Security failures = criminal liability for executives
- **TSA Pipeline Security**: Expanding to electric/gas convergence at Aliso Canyon
- **CCPA/CPRA**: 10M+ customer records require protection or massive fines
- **SEC Cyber Disclosure**: 4-day notification for material incidents (8-K requirement)

4. **Regulatory Momentum**: Requirements accelerating
5. **Window Closing**: Proactive advantage disappearing

### Executive Message

"Regulatory compliance has evolved from paperwork to survival. With executives facing personal criminal liability for cybersecurity failures and fines reaching $20 million per violation, SCE must immediately transform its compliance posture from reactive to proactive. The proposed investment not only ensures compliance but positions SCE as the preferred operator of critical infrastructure in California. Every day of delay increases personal liability and corporate risk exponentially."

---

**Strategic Imperative**: Southern California Edison faces an unprecedented regulatory environment where cybersecurity compliance failures trigger executive criminal prosecution, massive fines, and potential loss of operating authority. The convergence of federal, state, and sector-specific requirements creates complexity that SCE's current reactive approach cannot address. Immediate implementation of a comprehensive compliance transformation program is not optional—it is essential for corporate survival and executive freedom. The proposed NCC OTCE-Dragos partnership provides the only proven platform for achieving and maintaining compliance while transforming regulatory burden into competitive advantage.
