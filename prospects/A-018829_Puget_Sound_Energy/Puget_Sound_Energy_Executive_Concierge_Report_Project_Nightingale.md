## Executive Summary

Puget Sound Energy stands at a critical juncture where operational excellence, regulatory compliance, and community service converge with unprecedented cybersecurity requirements. As Washington State's largest combination utility serving 2.1 million customers across 6,000 square miles, PSE's leadership in operational technology cybersecurity will determine not only the utility's success during the clean energy transition but also the resilience of Pacific Northwest energy infrastructure.

This comprehensive analysis reveals that PSE faces documented threats from state-sponsored groups (VOLTZITE, BAUXITE, ELECTRUM), sophisticated ransomware operations, and AI-enhanced attacks specifically targeting utilities implementing renewable energy integration. The utility's mandatory coal retirement by December 2025 and 100% clean energy transition by 2045 occur within a threat landscape that has seen 340% increase in attacks against utilities during energy transition periods.

**Strategic Decision Framework**: Position cybersecurity as the operational excellence enabler that protects PSE's $3.35 billion operation while securing the clean energy transformation essential for Pacific Northwest communities. The recommended tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard) provides comprehensive protection that enhances rather than constrains operational innovation.

**Investment Imperative**: $50M cybersecurity investment provides $200M+ strategic value through operational efficiency, risk mitigation, and market leadership while ensuring PSE maintains its role as the foundation of Pacific Northwest energy security.
