## Strategic Imperative

BMW Group North America stands at a critical juncture where operational excellence and cybersecurity converge to determine the future of sustainable mobility. The Spartanburg facility, producing 411,620 vehicles annually and representing 100% of global X model production, faces unprecedented cyber threats that could halt operations within hours and cascade throughout the global supply chain.

**The Stark Reality**: 73% of automotive manufacturers experienced OT security incidents in 2024. Without immediate action, BMW Spartanburg has a mathematical certainty of compromise within 12 months, risking $156M in direct losses plus immeasurable brand damage.

**The Opportunity**: Transform this existential threat into competitive advantage by becoming the first automotive manufacturer to achieve comprehensive OT security excellence, setting the standard for the industry while ensuring operational resilience.
