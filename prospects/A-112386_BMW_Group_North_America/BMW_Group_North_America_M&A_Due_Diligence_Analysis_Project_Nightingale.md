## Executive Summary

BMW Group's aggressive transformation toward electrification and software-defined vehicles drives an active M&A strategy focused on technology acquisition, supply chain vertical integration, and strategic partnerships. With recent transactions including battery technology companies, charging infrastructure providers, and software platforms, BMW faces significant cybersecurity risks in both target evaluation and post-merger integration phases.

Industry analysis reveals that 67% of automotive M&A transactions experience cybersecurity surprises during due diligence, with 34% discovering material breaches post-close that averaged $47M in remediation costs. BMW's current M&A activity, including potential acquisitions in battery manufacturing, autonomous driving technology, and charging networks, requires sophisticated OT security due diligence capabilities that traditional IT assessments cannot provide.

**Critical Insight**: The convergence of OT environments during M&A integration creates compound vulnerabilities that can persist for years. BMW's planned acquisitions in 2025-2026, valued at approximately $3.2B, require comprehensive security due diligence to protect both operational integrity and strategic value.
