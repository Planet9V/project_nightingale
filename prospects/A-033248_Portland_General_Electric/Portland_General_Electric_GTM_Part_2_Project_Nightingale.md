## Executive Summary

Portland General Electric's (PGE) operational technology infrastructure represents a critical attack surface requiring immediate security enhancement. As Oregon's largest utility managing 3,300+ MW of generation capacity across 30,000 miles of transmission and distribution infrastructure, PGE faces escalating threats from nation-state actors targeting the electric sector. The convergence of IT/OT systems through AVEVA System Platform integration, combined with aggressive decarbonization goals requiring 2,700-3,700 MW of new renewable capacity by 2030, creates unprecedented security challenges that the NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution is uniquely positioned to address.

**Key Operational Vulnerabilities Identified:**
- 825,000 smart meters with Landis & Gyr vulnerability exposure
- 32 distributed generation sites controlled through GenOnSys lacking dedicated OT security
- AVEVA System Platform integration points vulnerable to DERMS exploitation
- 475+ MW battery storage systems without specialized OT protection
- Legacy vendor connections bypassing security perimeters
