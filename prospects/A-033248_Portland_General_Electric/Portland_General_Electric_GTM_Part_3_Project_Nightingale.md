## Executive Summary

Portland General Electric's leadership structure reveals a sophisticated decision-making framework with clear operational technology security gaps at the executive level. The absence of a dedicated CISO, combined with a dual-CIO structure and recent operational leadership changes, creates both challenges and opportunities for strategic engagement. Maria Pope's industry leadership role as Edison Electric Institute Chair positions PGE for transformational security initiatives that could establish sector-wide best practices.

**Key Engagement Insights:**
- **Decision Authority**: Distributed between IT (Henderson/Kochavatr) and Operations (Powell)
- **Budget Control**: CFO Trpik controls strategic investments with Board oversight
- **Security Gap**: No C-level security executive creates visibility challenge
- **Timing Opportunity**: 2025 holding company restructuring enables transformation
- **Champion Potential**: Keegan Reichert positioned for expanded authority

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Build Reichert as internal champion
2. Align with Powell's operational resilience priorities
3. Navigate dual CIO structure carefully
4. Quantify financial benefits for Trpik
5. Position Pope as industry security leader

**Next Steps:**
1. CISO roundtable invitation to Reichert
