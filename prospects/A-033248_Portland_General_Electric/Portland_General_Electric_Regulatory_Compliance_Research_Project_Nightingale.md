## Executive Summary

Portland General Electric operates within an increasingly complex regulatory environment where federal reliability standards, state cybersecurity mandates, and wildfire mitigation requirements converge to create unprecedented compliance challenges. The implementation of NERC CIP Version 8, Oregon SB-1567 cybersecurity standards, and expanded wildfire mitigation obligations requires sophisticated operational technology security capabilities that traditional IT approaches cannot address. With $5.6M in historical NERC penalties and escalating regulatory scrutiny, PGE faces both significant compliance risk and opportunity for operational excellence through proactive security investment.

**Critical Compliance Drivers:**
- **NERC CIP-015**: Internal network monitoring requirements effective October 2025
- **Oregon SB-1567**: State cybersecurity standards with $500K per violation penalties
- **Wildfire Mitigation**: Real-time monitoring mandates creating new attack vectors
- **FERC Order 887**: Supply chain security requirements for critical components
- **DOE 100-Day Plan**: Enhanced visibility and threat information sharing obligations
