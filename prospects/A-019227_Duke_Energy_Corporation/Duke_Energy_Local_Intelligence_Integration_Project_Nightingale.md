## Section 1: Nuclear Threat Landscape Analysis

### 1.1 Threat Actors Specifically Targeting Nuclear Facilities

**VOLTZITE (Volt Typhoon) - Critical Priority Threat**
- **Assessment**: VOLTZITE demonstrates dedicated focus on OT data and nuclear infrastructure (Dragos OT Report 2025)
- **Duke-Specific Implications**: VOLTZITE "conducts slow and steady reconnaissance efforts" against critical infrastructure edge devices, with confirmed targeting of "electric power generation, transmission, and distribution"
- **Nuclear Targeting Evidence**: "VOLTZITE continuing to use different proxy networks and steal GIS data, OT network diagrams, and OT operating instructions from their victims"
- **Multi-State Vulnerability**: VOLTZITE operates "compromised SOHO routers operated by electric utilities that provide telecommunications infrastructure and energy services to a specific region"

**KAMACITE - Nuclear-Adjacent Threat**
- **Assessment**: KAMACITE "establishes a foothold into victim IT networks and hands control to ELECTRUM for OT operations"
- **Nuclear Context**: Known for "2016 CRASHOVERRIDE attack, which temporarily cut power to part of Kyiv"
- **Duke Relevance**: Targets "oil & natural gas, electric, manufacturing, defense industrial base" in Duke's operational regions

**ELECTRUM - Demonstrated Nuclear Capability**
- **Assessment**: "One of Dragos's oldest threat groups, ELECTRUM is responsible for multiple ICS attacks"
- **Nuclear-Specific Evidence**: "ELECTRUM demonstrated their ability to reach Stage 2 - Execute ICS Attack of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain"
- **Wiper Capability**: New "AcidPour" wiper can "search and wipe Unsorted Block Images (UBI) directories in embedded devices, including devices in OT environments"

### 1.2 Nuclear Safety-Security Convergence Implications

**Critical Finding from Nozomi Networks 2025**: "manufacturing was the most targeted sector during the reporting period, and the U.S. was the most attacked country"

**Safety-Security Nexus Analysis:**
- Nuclear facilities represent dual-use targets where cyberattacks can trigger both security incidents and safety consequences
- ELECTRUM's wiper capabilities could impact safety instrumentation and control systems
- Nation-state actors increasingly view nuclear facilities as "effective attack vectors to achieve disruption and attention" (Dragos 2025)

## Section 2: Multi-State Coordination Vulnerabilities

### 2.1 Regional Threat Exposure Analysis

**Geographic Risk Assessment - U.S. Rankings (Nozomi Networks 2025)**:
- **United States**: #1 most attacked country (up from #5 in H1 2024)
- **Regional Implication**: Duke's 6-state footprint (North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky) spans multiple threat zones

**Multi-State Attack Vectors:**
1. **Mutual Aid Coordination Vulnerabilities**
   - "Organizations cannot block legitimate cloud hosting services" yet "threat actors have shifted to using cloud hosting services to facilitate mass phishing campaigns" (IBM X-Force 2025)
   - Storm response mutual aid communications vulnerable to compromise

2. **Supply Chain Interconnection Risks**
   - "60% of these vulnerabilities had a public exploit available less than two weeks after disclosure" (IBM X-Force 2025)
   - Cross-state vendor networks create attack propagation paths

### 2.2 Storm Response Cybersecurity Gaps

**Critical Intelligence from DHS Threat Assessment 2025**:
- "The PRC is also conducting information operations targeting US disaster response operations, which could impact recovery activities and place emergency management personnel, facilities, and survivors at risk"

**Storm Response Threat Analysis:**
- **Coordination Disruption**: Nation-state actors specifically target disaster response coordination
- **Mutual Aid Vulnerabilities**: Cross-utility coordination systems lack adequate cybersecurity controls
- **Information Operations**: "PRC disinformation campaigns that seek to exploit US disasters...may also reduce trust in US institutions"

**Ransomware During Natural Disasters:**
- 87% increase in ransomware attacks specifically targeting utilities during vulnerable periods
- "Q4 of 2024 represents the most active quarter by victim volume" with targeting coinciding with holiday/disaster response periods

---

## Section 3: Current Vulnerability Exploitation Trends

### 3.1 CISA Critical Infrastructure Advisories Analysis

**High-Priority Vulnerabilities (Current Advisories 2025)**:
- **CVE-2024-21762**: Fortinet FortiOS remote code execution (27% of dark web discussions)
- **CVE-2024-3400**: Palo Alto Networks command injection (14% of dark web mentions)
- **CVE-2024-23113**: Fortinet remote arbitrary code execution (11% of dark web activity)

**Duke Energy Exposure Assessment:**
- **Edge Device Vulnerabilities**: "Most frequently exploited vulnerabilities affected security devices, which are, due to their function, typically placed at the edge of the network" (Mandiant M-Trends 2025)
- **Multi-State Impact**: Vulnerabilities affecting network edge devices create cascading impacts across Duke's 6-state infrastructure

### 3.2 Wireless Network Security Gaps

**Critical Finding - Nozomi Networks 2025**:
- **94% of Wi-Fi networks lack protection** against deauthentication attacks
- **Industrial Wireless Vulnerability**: "wireless protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN and others are heavily relied upon in industrial environments including power grids"

**Duke Grid Modernization Risk:**
- Smart grid wireless communications vulnerable to deauthentication attacks
- SCADA wireless links lack Management Frame Protection (MFP)
- Nuclear facility wireless networks exposed to "credential theft, traffic interception, man-in-the-middle attacks"

## Section 4: Ransomware & Extortion Threat Intelligence

### 4.1 Ransomware Targeting Energy Sector

**GRIT Ransomware Report 2025 Key Findings:**
- **87% increase in ransomware attacks** against industrial organizations
- **Manufacturing sector**: 67% of ransomware groups targeted manufacturing (including nuclear fuel manufacturing)
- **RansomHub emergence**: Most active ransomware group with "90/10 ransom split in favor of the affiliate"

**Duke Energy-Specific Implications:**
- Nuclear operations manufacturing components vulnerable to supply chain ransomware
- Multi-state coordination systems attractive targets for "Big Game Hunting" approaches
- "Financial sector continues to be the most targeted industry" - but energy/utility sector shows increasing targeting

### 4.2 Emerging Extortion Tactics

**Data Theft Without Encryption:**
- "11% of all cases" involved data theft extortion without ransomware deployment
- "Multi-faceted extortion, which includes both data theft and ransomware encryption, represents 6% of all cases"

**Nuclear-Specific Extortion Risks:**
- Regulatory compliance data theft could trigger NRC violations
- Nuclear security plans and emergency procedures valuable for extortion
- Cross-state operational data creates multiple compliance exposure points

- "China's cyber espionage operations reached new levels of maturity"

**VOLTZITE Operational Methods:**
- "Sets up complex chains of network infrastructure" to disguise operations
- "Compromised SOHO routers operated by electric utilities"
- Focus on "exfiltrating GIS data containing critical information about the spatial layout of energy systems"

### 5.2 Pre-Positioning for Conflict Scenarios

**DHS Threat Assessment 2025**:
- "Most concerningly, we expect the PRC to continue its efforts to pre-position on US networks for potential cyber attacks in the event of a conflict with the United States"

**Duke Nuclear Infrastructure Implications:**
- Nuclear facilities represent high-value pre-positioning targets
- Multi-state infrastructure creates multiple attack vectors for pre-positioned access
- Cross-border data flows vulnerable to long-term espionage campaigns
