## Executive Summary

Duke Energy Corporation operates under one of the most complex regulatory frameworks in the U.S. electric utility sector, spanning six states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky) and multiple federal agencies. This regulatory complexity creates unique cybersecurity compliance challenges requiring specialized expertise in nuclear safety regulations (NRC), electric reliability standards (NERC CIP), multi-state coordination requirements, and emerging cybersecurity mandates.

**Key Compliance Challenges:**
- **Nuclear Regulatory Overlap**: Managing NRC nuclear safety requirements alongside NERC CIP bulk electric system standards creates regulatory gaps requiring specialized expertise
- **Multi-State Coordination**: Six different state regulatory frameworks with varying cybersecurity requirements demand comprehensive compliance strategies  
- **Critical Infrastructure Mandates**: New federal cybersecurity requirements (CIRCIA, Pipeline Security Guidelines) impose additional compliance burdens
- **Storm Response Regulations**: Hurricane preparedness and mutual aid coordination regulations require cybersecurity considerations

This analysis demonstrates how Project Nightingale's tri-partner solution (NCC + Dragos + Adelard) provides comprehensive regulatory expertise addressing Duke Energy's unique compliance environment.
