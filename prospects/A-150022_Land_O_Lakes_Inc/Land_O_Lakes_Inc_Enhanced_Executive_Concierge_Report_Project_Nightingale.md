## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Why This Report Matters Now

Land O'Lakes faces CONFIRMED active compromise: DragonForce ransomware successfully infiltrated your systems January 31, 2025¹, demonstrating immediate vulnerability while you serve 300,000+ farmers² and process 12 billion pounds of milk annually³. With agricultural cybercrime rising exponentially⁴, your $15B cooperative⁵ managing 30+ dairy plants and 160+ feed mills⁶ creates catastrophic food security risk. The FBI's August 2024 warning that "cyber risk to farms...is growing exponentially"⁷ combined with your R7 precision agriculture platform serving America's farmers⁸ demands immediate action to protect both cooperative members and Project Nightingale's mission of ensuring healthy food for future generations.

**Critical Context**: As America's member-owned agricultural cooperative, Land O'Lakes' operational security directly impacts national food security, 300,000 farming families, and the sustainable production of dairy, feed, and agricultural products essential to feeding the nation.
