Current gaps in backup isolation, network segmentation, and incident response capability must be addressed within 30-90 days.

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. **Immediate** (0-30 days): Backup isolation and network segmentation
2. **Urgent** (30-60 days): Detection enhancement and response planning
3. **Important** (60-90 days): Recovery testing and customer assurance program

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero successful ransomware attacks
- 4-hour recovery capability achievement
- Customer confidence maintained
- Regulatory compliance assured
- Market leadership position secured

The tri-partner solution provides exactly the specialized expertise required to transform Veson from a high-risk target to a resilient maritime platform leader. The time for action is now - before DeepBlue or similar groups execute their planning.
