## 2025 Threat Landscape Evolution

### Advanced Persistent Threat Activity Surge

According to the **Dragos OT Cybersecurity Report: A Year in Review 2025**, operational technology threats have evolved significantly with new attack techniques specifically targeting energy sector operations:

**Critical Finding:** Industrial control system (ICS) incidents increased 40% year-over-year, with energy sector representing 35% of all OT-specific attacks. The report identifies "awareness over sophistication" as a key theme, indicating threat actors are developing improved understanding of industrial operations rather than relying solely on advanced technical capabilities.

**Evergy-Relevant Implications:**
- **Nuclear Operations:** Specialized threats targeting safety-critical systems require enhanced protection for Wolf Creek Nuclear Station
- **Grid Operations:** Transmission and distribution SCADA systems face increased targeting from nation-state actors
- **Smart Grid Infrastructure:** AMI networks and distribution automation create expanded attack surfaces requiring comprehensive monitoring

### Nation-State Actor Evolution

The **CrowdStrike 2025 Global Threat Report** reveals alarming trends in nation-state activity directly relevant to Evergy's operational environment:

**China-Nexus Activity Surge:** Chinese threat actor activity increased 150% overall, with energy and utilities suffering 200-300% more attacks than the previous year. This dramatic escalation aligns with geopolitical tensions and demonstrates systematic targeting of critical infrastructure.

**Key Threat Actor Groups:**
- **VOLTZITE:** Advanced Chinese group conducting prolonged reconnaissance campaigns against energy infrastructure
- **KAMACITE:** Russian-affiliated actors targeting transmission and distribution operations
- **ELECTRUM:** Sophisticated group focusing on nuclear facility reconnaissance and intelligence gathering

**Strategic Intelligence:** Evergy's nuclear operations at Wolf Creek and critical transmission infrastructure across the Kansas-Missouri region create high-value targets for nation-state intelligence gathering and potential disruption operations.

### Operational Technology Malware Evolution

The **Dragos 2025 Report** introduces critical updates on ICS-specific malware directly threatening utility operations:

**FrostyGoop Malware:** Discovered in attacks against Ukrainian heating infrastructure, this malware specifically targets Modbus communication protocols commonly used in utility SCADA systems. The malware demonstrates capability to:
- **Disrupt industrial communications** between control systems and field devices
