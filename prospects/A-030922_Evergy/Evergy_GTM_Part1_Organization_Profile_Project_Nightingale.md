## Technical Infrastructure Assessment

### Operational Technology Architecture

**Industrial Control Systems**
Evergy operates a sophisticated multi-layered industrial control environment managing generation, transmission, and distribution operations across its diverse asset portfolio. The Wolf Creek Nuclear Station requires specialized safety-critical control systems meeting NRC cybersecurity requirements, while fossil generation relies on distributed control systems (DCS) for operational optimization. The transmission network utilizes SCADA systems for real-time monitoring and control of the high-voltage grid, with protective relay systems providing automated fault detection and isolation.

**Energy Management Systems**
The company's Energy Management System (EMS) serves as the central nervous system for grid operations, integrating real-time data from generation resources, transmission networks, and distribution feeders. Advanced applications include state estimation, contingency analysis, and optimal power flow calculations supporting reliable service delivery. Load forecasting systems utilize weather data and historical patterns to optimize generation dispatch and maintenance scheduling.

**Nuclear Safety Systems**
Wolf Creek Nuclear Station operates multiple independent safety systems requiring the highest levels of cybersecurity protection. These include reactor protection systems, engineered safety features, and emergency response capabilities designed to maintain safe operations under all conditions. The facility's defense-in-depth cybersecurity approach aligns with NRC guidelines while supporting operational excellence.

### IT/OT Convergence Challenges

**Legacy System Integration**
Evergy's operational environment includes industrial control systems spanning multiple decades, creating complex integration challenges as the company modernizes its technology infrastructure. Legacy systems often lack modern cybersecurity features, requiring specialized approaches to protect critical operations while enabling data analytics and remote monitoring capabilities.

**Multi-Vendor Environment**
The utility's technology ecosystem includes major industrial automation vendors such as GE, Schneider Electric, ABB, and Siemens for different operational domains. This diversity creates coordination challenges for cybersecurity policies and procedures while requiring vendor-neutral security approaches that protect all operational technology assets.

**Regulatory Complexity**
As a dual-state utility with nuclear operations, Evergy must navigate NERC CIP cybersecurity standards, NRC nuclear cybersecurity requirements, and state regulatory frameworks in both Kansas and Missouri. This regulatory complexity requires sophisticated compliance management and documentation capabilities.

### Smart Grid & Digital Transformation

**Advanced Metering Infrastructure**
Evergy has deployed AMI across its service territory, creating bidirectional communication networks supporting demand response, outage management, and customer engagement programs. These smart grid investments enable operational efficiency while creating new cybersecurity considerations for distributed endpoints.

**Distributed Energy Resource Management**
The company's renewable energy portfolio and customer-owned distributed generation require sophisticated management systems for grid stability and power quality. DERMS capabilities include forecasting, dispatch optimization, and voltage regulation to maintain reliable service as renewable penetration increases.

**Grid Automation & Analytics**
Distribution automation investments include smart switches, reclosers, and voltage regulators enabling faster outage restoration and improved power quality. Advanced analytics platforms process operational data for predictive maintenance, asset optimization, and customer service improvements.
