## Project Nightingale: Partnership Structure & Security Governance Assessment

**Document Classification**: Confidential - Strategic Intelligence

## Executive Summary

Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP's complex partnership structure, with TC Energy holding 50% operational control alongside four other stakeholders, creates unique cybersecurity governance challenges that significantly impact M&A attractiveness and valuation. Based on 2025 market intelligence, pipeline assets with mature OT security programs command 15-25% valuation premiums, while those with security gaps face increasing scrutiny from buyers concerned about hidden cyber liabilities. The current governance structure, lacking unified security decision-making authority and comprehensive OT protection, positions IGTS at a significant disadvantage in potential transaction scenarios. Implementation of the NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution would transform IGTS from a liability-laden asset to a premium infrastructure investment.

**Critical Finding**: Current cybersecurity posture could reduce IGTS valuation by $300-500M (20-30%) in any strategic transaction.
