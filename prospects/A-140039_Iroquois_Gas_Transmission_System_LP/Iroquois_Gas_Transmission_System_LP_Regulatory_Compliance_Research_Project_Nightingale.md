## Executive Summary

Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP faces an unprecedented regulatory compliance challenge with the July 2025 implementation of TSA Security Directive SD-02E, requiring comprehensive cybersecurity measures that current capabilities cannot meet. The convergence of federal pipeline security mandates, FERC reliability standards, and multi-state regulatory requirements creates a complex compliance landscape with severe penalties for non-compliance. Based on 2025 regulatory intelligence, IGTS requires $8-12M in security investments to achieve compliance, with the NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution providing the only comprehensive path to meeting all regulatory obligations while maintaining operational excellence.

**Critical Compliance Gap**: IGTS currently meets only 23% of TSA SD-02E requirements, with $2.3M daily penalty exposure beginning July 2025.
