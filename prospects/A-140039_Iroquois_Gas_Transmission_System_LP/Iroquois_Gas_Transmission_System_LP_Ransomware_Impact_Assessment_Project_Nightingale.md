## Executive Summary

Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP faces extreme ransomware risk due to its single-pipeline criticality serving 14 power plants and millions of Northeast consumers. Based on 2025 threat intelligence from Guidepoint, ReliaQuest, and IBM X-Force, pipeline-focused ransomware groups have increased attacks by 412% year-over-year, with average demands of $25M and operational impacts lasting 7-21 days. For IGTS, a successful ransomware attack during winter peak demand could trigger cascading failures across energy, water, and food systems, resulting in $50M daily economic impact and potential loss of life. The NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution provides comprehensive ransomware resilience through prevention, detection, response, and recovery capabilities.

**Critical Finding**: IGTS's current ransomware readiness score is 2.1/10, with recovery time objective (RTO) of 14-21 days against a maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) of 72 hours.
