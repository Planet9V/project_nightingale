## Executive Summary

Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP faces an unprecedented convergence of sophisticated threat actors specifically targeting single-pipeline critical infrastructure in 2025. Based on intelligence from Dragos, CrowdStrike, and Mandiant, three primary nation-state actors - VOLTZITE, BAUXITE, and GRAPHITE - have demonstrated specific interest in Northeast US pipeline infrastructure. The combination of IGTS's single-pipeline criticality, winter dependency patterns, and IT/OT convergence vulnerabilities creates an extreme risk profile requiring immediate implementation of the NCC Group OTCE + Dragos + Adelard tri-partner solution.

**Critical Assessment**: IGTS matches 94% of targeting criteria used by advanced persistent threats, representing one of the highest-risk profiles in North American pipeline infrastructure.
