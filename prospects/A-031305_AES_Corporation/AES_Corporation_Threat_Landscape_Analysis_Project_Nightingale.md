# AES Corporation - Threat Landscape Analysis
## Project Nightingale: Comprehensive Operational Technology Threat Assessment

### Executive Summary

AES Corporation faces a sophisticated and rapidly evolving threat landscape specifically targeting energy sector operational technology, with nation-state actors pre-positioning for potential future conflicts, specialized industrial malware designed to disrupt power generation, and criminal ransomware groups increasingly focusing on operational technology systems. The company's aggressive clean energy transition timeline, combined with operations across 14 countries, creates a complex threat environment requiring comprehensive operational technology security solutions that protect critical infrastructure while enabling business transformation.

This threat landscape analysis reveals three critical threat convergence factors: 1) AES's December 2025 coal retirement creating vulnerable transition periods with legacy system integration challenges, 2) Nation-state actors like Volt Typhoon specifically pre-positioning in US critical infrastructure, and 3) The emergence of industrial-specific malware (Fuxnet, FrostyGoop) proving real-world capability to disrupt energy operations. The tri-partner solution addresses these threats through specialized operational technology expertise, industry-specific threat intelligence, and comprehensive incident response capabilities.
