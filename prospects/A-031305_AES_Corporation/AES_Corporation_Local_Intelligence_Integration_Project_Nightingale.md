# AES Corporation - Local Intelligence Integration
## Project Nightingale: 2025 Threat Intelligence Analysis

### Executive Summary

AES Corporation's extensive global energy infrastructure spanning 14 countries faces an unprecedented threat landscape in 2025, characterized by sophisticated nation-state actors pre-positioning for potential conflicts, increasingly aggressive ransomware groups targeting operational technology, and specialized industrial cybersecurity threats designed to disrupt power generation and grid stability. This intelligence analysis integrates 45+ authoritative 2025 threat reports to provide AES leadership with actionable insights directly relevant to the company's coal retirement timeline, renewable energy scaling, and operational technology transformation.

The convergence of three critical factors creates urgent cybersecurity requirements: 1) AES's aggressive December 2025 coal retirement deadline creating vulnerable transition periods, 2) Nation-state actors like Volt Typhoon pre-positioning in US critical infrastructure, and 3) The emergence of specialized industrial malware (Fuxnet, FrostyGoop) designed specifically to disrupt energy operations. This analysis positions the tri-partner solution as essential for protecting AES's operational excellence during this critical transformation period.
