# AES Corporation - Operational Analysis & Strategic Sales Intelligence
## GTM Part 2: Project Nightingale Operational Assessment

### Executive Summary

AES Corporation's aggressive clean energy transition and global operational footprint present extraordinary cybersecurity challenges that directly impact the company's ability to deliver reliable energy to millions of customers across 14 countries. As AES executes its commitment to exit coal generation by December 2025 while scaling renewable energy capacity, the company faces unprecedented operational technology risks requiring specialized cybersecurity solutions focused on operational excellence rather than traditional IT security approaches.

This operational analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities in AES's transition period, where legacy coal plant control systems must integrate with modern renewable energy management platforms while maintaining grid reliability and worker safety. The tri-partner solution (NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard) addresses these operational challenges through specialized OT cybersecurity expertise that enables rather than constrains AES's clean energy transformation.
