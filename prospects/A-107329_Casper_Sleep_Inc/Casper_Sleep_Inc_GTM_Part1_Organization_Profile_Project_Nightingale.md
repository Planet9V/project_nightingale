## Executive Summary

Casper Sleep Inc. presents a compelling strategic opportunity within Project Nightingale's mission to secure "clean water, reliable energy, healthy food" through operational technology excellence. As a newly-acquired subsidiary of Carpenter Co., the world's largest vertically integrated polyurethane foam manufacturer, Casper operates at the intersection of advanced manufacturing, direct-to-consumer e-commerce, and supply chain complexity that requires sophisticated operational technology security frameworks.

Under CEO Joe Megibow's turnaround strategy since January 2024, Casper has transitioned from a venture-backed growth model to a profit-focused operational excellence paradigm. This strategic shift, combined with integration into Carpenter Co.'s extensive manufacturing ecosystem (70+ global production facilities), creates significant operational technology security requirements across manufacturing automation, supply chain visibility, and quality control systems.

The company's $580M+ annual revenue operation spans complex technical infrastructure including:
- Advanced manufacturing and automation systems for sleep product production
- Sophisticated supply chain management across North American operations
- Omnichannel retail technology supporting 66+ physical locations and e-commerce platform
- Quality control and safety systems ensuring product compliance
- Industrial IoT integration for production optimization and efficiency

**Strategic Positioning**: Casper represents a high-value prospect for NCC Group's OTCE solution suite, particularly given the recent organizational transformation requiring enhanced operational visibility, manufacturing security, and supply chain resilience.
