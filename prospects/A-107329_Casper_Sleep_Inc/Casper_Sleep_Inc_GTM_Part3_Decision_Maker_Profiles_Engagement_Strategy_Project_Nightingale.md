## Executive Summary

Casper Sleep Inc.'s decision-making structure under CEO Joe Megibow's turnaround leadership presents exceptional engagement opportunities for NCC Group's OTCE solution portfolio. The company's transformation from venture-backed growth to manufacturing-focused operational excellence creates favorable conditions for strategic technology investments aligned with Project Nightingale's mission.

- **Centralized Authority**: CEO Megibow has enhanced decision-making power due to C-suite vacancies
- **Execution Focus**: "Execution over vision" approach favoring immediate implementation
- **ROI Mandate**: Technology investments must demonstrate clear profitability impact
- **Integration Requirements**: Carpenter Co. involvement in major strategic decisions

**Engagement Strategy**: Executive-level positioning of operational excellence solutions with clear ROI demonstration and immediate implementation pathways.
