# Pepco Holdings: Local Intelligence Integration - 2025 Mid-Atlantic Utility Threats
## Project Nightingale - Regional Infrastructure Protection

**Executive Summary**: Mid-Atlantic utilities face unprecedented cyber threats in 2025, with nation-state actors specifically targeting the Washington D.C. power grid, as documented in recent FBI warnings and CISA advisories showing a 300% increase in reconnaissance activities against critical infrastructure serving federal facilities, while regional threat actors exploit smart grid vulnerabilities and ransomware groups demand $10-50M payments from utilities.

## Regional Threat Landscape Analysis

### Geographic Threat Concentration

**National Capital Region Targeting**:
According to the 2025 DHS Threat Assessment, the Washington D.C. metropolitan area represents the highest-value target for adversarial nations seeking to disrupt U.S. government operations. The concentration of federal facilities, foreign embassies, and military installations creates what threat analysts term a "cyber ground zero" for infrastructure attacks.

**Mid-Atlantic Vulnerability Factors**:
1. **Interconnected Grid Architecture**: PJM coordination exposes regional dependencies
2. **Aging Infrastructure**: 40% of substations >50 years old (NERC 2025 Report)
3. **Smart Grid Proliferation**: 2.5M smart meters creating expanded attack surface
4. **Regulatory Complexity**: Four jurisdictions complicating security standardization
5. **Climate Vulnerabilities**: Increased storm frequency stressing backup systems
