## 60-Second Decision Brief

**The Situation**: Pepco Holdings faces unprecedented cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure serving the nation's capital, with nation-state actors actively reconnaissance your systems while regulatory requirements expand across four jurisdictions.

**The Risk**: Without advanced OT-specific protection, Pepco faces potential federal facility outages, $50M+ ransomware demands, and catastrophic regulatory penalties that could damage Exelon's reputation and financial performance.

**The Solution**: The NCC OTCE-Dragos-Adelard tri-partner solution transforms cybersecurity from compliance burden to operational enabler, providing nuclear-grade protection with proven 200-300% ROI.

**The Decision**: Authorize immediate Phase 1 implementation ($5-7M) to secure critical assets before peak summer demand, with full program deployment ($25-30M) protecting the entire $38B infrastructure investment.

**The Outcome**: Industry-leading cyber resilience protecting 2M customers, ensuring federal continuity, exceeding regulatory requirements, and positioning Pepco as the secure utility of choice for critical facilities.
