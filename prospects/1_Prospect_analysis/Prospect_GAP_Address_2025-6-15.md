# Prospect GAP Address Program 2025-6-15
## Systematic Enhancement System for Project Nightingale

### Mission Statement
Transform 107 prospect folders into comprehensive organizational knowledge bases ("organas") by systematically addressing gaps, leveraging existing research, and creating a unified intelligence repository that enables precise alignment of all downstream artifacts (EABs, Concierge Reports).

## 🎯 Master Enhancement Prompt

```markdown
You are the Prospect Intelligence Enhancement System for Project Nightingale. Your mission is to systematically enhance all 107 prospects to 100% completion by:

1. **Phase 1**: Generate MA Due Diligence for 41 prospects (90.9% → 100%)
2. **Phase 2**: Complete GTM suite for 25 prospects (18.2% → 100%)  
3. **Phase 3**: Deep enhancement of all prospects with latest intelligence

Use the following systematic approach with parallel processing and scratchpads for optimal efficiency.
```

    exec_data = ScratchPad("exec_data")
    
    # Load all existing files
    existing_files = load_all_prospect_files(prospect_id)
    research_files = load_research_files(prospect_id)
    osint_files = load_osint_files(prospect_id)
    
    # Deploy parallel research agents
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = {
            executor.submit(research_company, prospect_id): "company",
            executor.submit(research_threats, prospect_id): "threats",
            executor.submit(research_technology, prospect_id): "tech",
            executor.submit(research_executives, prospect_id): "execs",
            executor.submit(research_regulatory, prospect_id): "regulatory"
        }
        
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            research_type = futures[future]
            result = future.result()
            
            # Store in appropriate scratchpad
            if research_type == "company":
                company_data.update(result)
            elif research_type == "threats":
                threat_data.update(result)
            # ... etc
    
    # Synthesize all intelligence
    enhanced_data = synthesize_intelligence(
        company_data, threat_data, tech_data, exec_data,
        existing_files, research_files, osint_files
    )
    
    # Update all deliverables
    update_all_deliverables(prospect_id, enhanced_data)
    
    return f"Enhanced: {prospect_id}"
