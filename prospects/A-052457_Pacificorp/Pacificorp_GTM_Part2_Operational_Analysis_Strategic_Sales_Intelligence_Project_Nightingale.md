# Project Nightingale: GTM Part 2 - Operational Analysis & Strategic Sales Intelligence
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp's operational environment represents one of the most complex and strategically significant challenges in North American energy infrastructure protection. Managing the largest transmission grid in the Western United States while executing a $10+ billion renewable energy transformation creates unprecedented operational security requirements that traditional cybersecurity approaches cannot address effectively.

Analysis of PacifiCorp's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan reveals a fundamental reshaping of operational technology infrastructure, with 7,524 MW of energy storage deployment by 2045, massive renewable integration, and Enhanced Day-Ahead Market participation creating new attack vectors that sophisticated adversaries are actively targeting. Intelligence from Dragos's 2025 threat assessment indicates that VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, and BAUXITE threat groups have demonstrated specific capabilities against electric utility operational technology, with particular focus on transmission system disruption.

The organization's $1.265 billion wildfire-related losses in 2023 underscore the critical intersection of physical and cyber threats, where operational security failures can trigger catastrophic consequences extending beyond traditional business disruption to public safety and environmental impact. PacifiCorp's geographic footprint across six western states, combined with its role as a critical backbone for regional energy markets, makes operational continuity a matter of national energy security.

Strategic sales intelligence indicates optimal engagement timing driven by federal infrastructure funding commitments ($360 million for Project WIRE), aggressive modernization timelines (EDAM participation by 2026), and executive leadership change with CEO Cindy Crane's return bringing fresh perspective on operational excellence initiatives. The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise directly addresses PacifiCorp's operational challenges while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
