# Project Nightingale: Regulatory Compliance Research - Multi-Jurisdictional Framework
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp operates within one of the most complex regulatory environments in North American energy infrastructure, managing compliance obligations across six state jurisdictions, federal oversight agencies, and evolving cybersecurity standards that require specialized operational security capabilities rather than traditional IT compliance approaches. As the largest grid operator in the Western United States with 17,500 miles of transmission infrastructure, PacifiCorp must navigate NERC CIP mandatory standards, state-specific cybersecurity requirements, and emerging federal security mandates while maintaining operational excellence across diverse regulatory frameworks.

The organization's multi-state operational footprint creates unique compliance challenges where California's enhanced wildfire prevention cybersecurity requirements, Utah's potential corporate realignment mandates, and varying state energy policies demand coordinated compliance strategies that traditional cybersecurity vendors cannot adequately support. Federal oversight through FERC, DOE emergency authorities, and NERC reliability standards adds additional layers of mandatory compliance that directly impact operational technology security architecture and incident response capabilities.

PacifiCorp's $360 million federal funding commitment through Project WIRE creates additional compliance obligations tied to infrastructure security standards, while participation in Western Energy Imbalance Market and planned Extended Day-Ahead Market integration requires sophisticated cybersecurity capabilities that meet both NERC CIP standards and emerging market security requirements. The convergence of traditional reliability standards with evolving cybersecurity mandates demands integrated compliance approaches that demonstrate operational excellence rather than minimum regulatory satisfaction.

Analysis of 2025 regulatory evolution indicates significant expansion of cybersecurity requirements affecting electric utilities, with enhanced incident reporting obligations, supply chain risk management standards, and emerging artificial intelligence governance requirements that demand specialized compliance capabilities. The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise provides comprehensive compliance support while positioning PacifiCorp for regulatory leadership and operational excellence aligned with Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
