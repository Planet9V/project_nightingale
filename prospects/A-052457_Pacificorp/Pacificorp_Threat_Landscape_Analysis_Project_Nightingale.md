# Project Nightingale: Threat Landscape Analysis - Advanced Persistent Threats to Electric Utilities
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp operates within one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threat environments affecting critical infrastructure, where nation-state adversaries, criminal organizations, and hacktivists specifically target electric utility operational technology to achieve strategic objectives ranging from geopolitical leverage to financial gain. As the largest grid operator in the Western United States managing 17,500 miles of transmission infrastructure, PacifiCorp represents a primary target for threat actors seeking maximum operational impact and strategic advantage.

Analysis of 2025 threat intelligence reveals unprecedented escalation in adversary capabilities targeting electric utilities, with CrowdStrike's 2025 Global Threat Report documenting 26 new adversaries and 257 total tracked threat groups. The convergence of nation-state espionage, criminal ransomware operations, and hacktivist campaigns creates a multi-vector threat environment where traditional cybersecurity approaches prove inadequate for protecting operational technology systems that directly control power generation, transmission, and distribution.

Dragos's 2025 OT Cybersecurity Report identifies 9 active threat groups specifically targeting industrial control systems, including newly discovered BAUXITE and GRAPHITE groups demonstrating capabilities to cause loss of view and control in electric utility operations. The emergence of sophisticated ICS malware such as FrostyGoop and Fuxnet, combined with AI-enhanced social engineering and 51-second breakout times, demonstrates that adversaries have achieved operational tempo and technical sophistication that outpaces traditional defensive approaches.

PacifiCorp's massive $10+ billion infrastructure modernization, renewable energy integration, and Extended Day-Ahead Market participation create an expanding attack surface that sophisticated adversaries are actively targeting. The organization's role as critical backbone for Western energy markets, combined with its geographic footprint across six states, positions it as a high-value target where successful attacks could trigger cascading failures affecting regional energy security and economic stability.

The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise provides the specialized operational security capabilities required to defend against this sophisticated threat landscape while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
