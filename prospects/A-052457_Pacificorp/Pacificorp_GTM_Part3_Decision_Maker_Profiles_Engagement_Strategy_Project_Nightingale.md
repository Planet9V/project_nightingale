# Project Nightingale: GTM Part 3 - Decision-Maker Profiles & Engagement Strategy
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp's decision-making architecture reflects the complex interplay between subsidiary autonomy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy oversight, creating a multi-layered engagement strategy focused on operational excellence rather than traditional cybersecurity positioning. The return of CEO Cindy Crane in 2023 brings fresh leadership perspective to an organization managing unprecedented transformation while navigating billion-dollar wildfire liabilities and aggressive modernization timelines.

Key decision influencers span three critical levels: operational leadership driving day-to-day requirements (VP Transmission Rick Vail), corporate executives managing strategic direction (CEO Crane, CFO Kobliha), and BHE-level oversight providing ultimate approval authority (William Fehrman's historical cybersecurity influence). The organization's $6.6 billion revenue scale and status as the largest Western grid operator necessitates Board-level visibility for major security investments, particularly those exceeding traditional IT budget parameters.

Strategic engagement must address the unique challenges of a regulated utility with guaranteed cost recovery, where investment decisions require demonstrable regulatory value and alignment with prudent utility management principles. The 2025 Integrated Resource Plan's $10+ billion modernization commitment creates natural integration points for operational security capabilities, while federal funding opportunities through Project WIRE provide favorable investment conditions.

Decision-maker analysis reveals preference for operational excellence positioning over traditional cybersecurity approaches, with particular emphasis on protecting massive infrastructure investments while enabling aggressive renewable energy transformation. The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise aligns directly with PacifiCorp's operational requirements while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
