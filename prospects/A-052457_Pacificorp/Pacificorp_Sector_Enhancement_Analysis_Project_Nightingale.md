# Project Nightingale: Sector Enhancement Analysis - Electric Utility Industry
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

The electric utility sector stands at a critical inflection point where traditional cybersecurity approaches prove inadequate for protecting operational technology environments that directly impact public safety, economic stability, and national security. PacifiCorp's position as the largest grid operator in the Western United States exemplifies the complex challenges facing modern utilities: managing century-old infrastructure alongside cutting-edge renewable energy systems while defending against sophisticated nation-state adversaries specifically targeting critical energy infrastructure.

Analysis of 2025 sector intelligence reveals that electric utilities face unique operational security requirements that differ fundamentally from other industries. While manufacturing experienced the highest number of cyberattacks (four consecutive years), energy infrastructure represents a higher-stakes environment where operational disruption can trigger cascading failures affecting millions of customers, regional economic activity, and national energy security. The sector's regulatory environment, characterized by NERC CIP mandatory standards and multi-jurisdictional oversight, demands security solutions that demonstrate compliance value alongside operational protection.

PacifiCorp's $10+ billion infrastructure modernization program, encompassing 7,524 MW of energy storage deployment and massive renewable integration, mirrors sector-wide trends toward digital transformation that create new attack vectors while expanding operational capabilities. The organization's geographic footprint across six western states and critical role in regional energy markets position it as both a high-value target for adversaries and a potential model for sector-wide security enhancement.

The convergence of operational technology evolution, regulatory requirements expansion, and threat actor sophistication creates unprecedented demand for specialized security capabilities that traditional IT vendors cannot provide. The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise addresses these sector-specific requirements while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery through operational excellence.
