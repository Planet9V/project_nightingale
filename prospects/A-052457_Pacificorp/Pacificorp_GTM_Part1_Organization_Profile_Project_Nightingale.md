# Project Nightingale: GTM Part 1 - Organization Profile & Technical Infrastructure
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp stands as the largest grid operator in the Western United States, representing a critical infrastructure asset serving 2.1 million customers across six states through an operational technology ecosystem that has become increasingly attractive to advanced persistent threat actors. As a Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary with a $6.6 billion revenue footprint, PacifiCorp operates 17,500 miles of transmission lines, 66,900 miles of distribution infrastructure, and manages a diverse generation portfolio transitioning from coal to renewables under aggressive decarbonization mandates.

The organization's strategic transformation, outlined in its 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, involves massive investments in utility-scale solar (4,765 MW by 2045), wind generation (3,782 MW), and advanced energy storage technologies including iron-air batteries. This modernization effort dramatically expands the attack surface while introducing complex OT/IT convergence challenges that demand sophisticated operational security capabilities rather than traditional cybersecurity approaches.

Current threat intelligence indicates that threat groups specifically targeting energy infrastructure have significantly escalated their activities. Dragos's 2025 OT Cybersecurity Report identifies 9 active threat groups, with VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, and newly identified BAUXITE demonstrating particular focus on electric utility operations. PacifiCorp's extensive transmission network and critical role in Western energy markets position it as a high-value target for state-sponsored adversaries seeking to disrupt critical infrastructure.

The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE (Operational Technology Center of Excellence), Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise addresses PacifiCorp's specific operational requirements while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of ensuring reliable energy delivery to support healthy communities.
