# Project Nightingale: Local Intelligence Integration - 2025 Threat Analysis
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp's operational environment faces unprecedented threats from sophisticated adversaries specifically targeting electric utility infrastructure, with 2025 intelligence indicating significant escalation in both state-sponsored and criminal threat actor activities. As the largest grid operator in the Western United States managing 17,500 miles of transmission infrastructure and 2.1 million customers, PacifiCorp represents a high-value target for threat groups seeking to disrupt critical energy infrastructure or leverage industrial espionage for geopolitical advantage.

Analysis of 2025 threat intelligence from leading security organizations reveals that manufacturing and energy sectors continue to be primary targets, with manufacturing experiencing the highest number of ransomware cases and energy infrastructure facing 26% of attacks exploiting public-facing applications. Dragos's 2025 OT Cybersecurity Report identifies 9 active threat groups, including newly discovered BAUXITE and GRAPHITE, specifically targeting operational technology environments with capabilities to cause loss of view and control in industrial systems.

The convergence of PacifiCorp's massive $10+ billion infrastructure modernization program, aggressive renewable energy transition timeline, and expanding digital attack surface creates a perfect storm scenario that sophisticated adversaries are positioned to exploit. IBM X-Force's 2025 Threat Intelligence Index highlights the growing use of identity-based attacks (30% of intrusions) and AI-enhanced threat capabilities, while DHS assessments warn of increased targeting of critical infrastructure by nation-state actors supporting geopolitical objectives.

This intelligence integration demonstrates the critical need for operational security capabilities that go beyond traditional cybersecurity approaches, requiring specialized OT protection, advanced threat detection, and coordinated incident response designed specifically for electric utility environments. The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise directly addresses these specific threats while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
