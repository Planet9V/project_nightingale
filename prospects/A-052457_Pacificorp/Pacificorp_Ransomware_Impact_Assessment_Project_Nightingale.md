# Project Nightingale: Ransomware Impact Assessment - Critical Infrastructure Analysis
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp faces unprecedented ransomware threats that target both traditional IT systems and operational technology infrastructure critical for power generation, transmission, and distribution serving 2.1 million customers across six western states. As the largest grid operator in the Western United States managing 17,500 miles of transmission infrastructure, a successful ransomware attack against PacifiCorp could trigger cascading failures affecting regional energy security, economic stability, and public safety across multiple state jurisdictions.

Analysis of 2025 threat intelligence reveals that ransomware groups increasingly target critical infrastructure for maximum financial and operational impact, with utilities representing high-value targets willing to pay significant ransoms to maintain essential services. Guidepoint's 2025 Ransomware Annual Report documents utility-specific targeting strategies that combine data exfiltration with operational disruption threats, while industry incidents demonstrate that ransomware attacks can force utilities to implement manual operations, delay critical maintenance, and compromise emergency response capabilities.

PacifiCorp's massive $10+ billion infrastructure modernization program, including 7,524 MW of energy storage deployment and extensive renewable energy integration, creates expanding attack surfaces that sophisticated ransomware operators actively target. The organization's complex operational environment spanning coal plants, renewable generation, advanced transmission systems, and emerging energy storage technologies provides multiple vectors for ransomware deployment while increasing potential operational impact from successful attacks.

The convergence of PacifiCorp's critical infrastructure responsibilities, substantial financial resources ($6.6 billion annual revenue), and complex multi-state regulatory environment creates optimal conditions for ransomware operations seeking maximum leverage and payment capability. Recent industry incidents, including the Colonial Pipeline shutdown and various water treatment facility attacks, demonstrate that ransomware targeting operational technology can force complete service shutdowns affecting millions of customers and triggering national security concerns.

The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise provides comprehensive ransomware protection specifically designed for operational technology environments while maintaining service reliability and supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery.
