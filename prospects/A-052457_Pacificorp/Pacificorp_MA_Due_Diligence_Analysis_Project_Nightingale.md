# Project Nightingale: M&A Due Diligence Analysis - Strategic Transactions and Security Implications
## Target Organization: PacifiCorp (A-052457)

---

### Executive Summary

PacifiCorp operates within a complex merger and acquisition environment where potential corporate restructuring, ongoing asset transactions, and strategic partnerships create significant cybersecurity due diligence requirements that extend beyond traditional IT security assessments to encompass operational technology systems critical for power generation, transmission, and distribution. As a Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary with a 115-year operating history and $6.6 billion annual revenue, PacifiCorp faces unique M&A scenarios including potential Utah-mandated corporate realignment, renewable energy asset acquisitions, and strategic technology partnerships that require specialized operational security due diligence.

The organization's recent strategic transactions, including the 2024 Arco Wind and Solar project acquisition and ongoing participation in federal infrastructure programs like Project WIRE, demonstrate active portfolio development that requires comprehensive cybersecurity assessment of acquired assets, vendors, and business partners. Utah's gubernatorial request for corporate realignment options by November 2024 creates potential for significant structural changes that could trigger complex due diligence requirements for asset separation, regulatory compliance transfer, and operational security responsibility allocation across potential new entities.

PacifiCorp's massive $10+ billion infrastructure modernization program involves continuous vendor relationships, technology acquisitions, and service partnerships that require ongoing cybersecurity due diligence to protect operational technology systems from supply chain compromise. The organization's role as the largest grid operator in the Western United States, combined with its participation in energy markets and regional coordination activities, creates additional due diligence requirements for any transactions affecting critical infrastructure operations or market participation capabilities.

Analysis of potential M&A scenarios affecting PacifiCorp reveals that traditional due diligence approaches prove inadequate for assessing operational technology security, regulatory compliance transfer, and critical infrastructure protection requirements. The convergence of federal CFIUS review requirements, NERC CIP compliance obligations, and multi-state regulatory approval processes demands specialized due diligence capabilities that address operational security alongside traditional financial and legal considerations.

The tri-partner solution combining NCC Group's OTCE, Dragos's industrial cybersecurity platform, and Adelard's safety engineering expertise provides comprehensive M&A due diligence capabilities specifically designed for electric utility operational environments while supporting Project Nightingale's mission of reliable energy delivery through secure transactions and strategic partnerships.
