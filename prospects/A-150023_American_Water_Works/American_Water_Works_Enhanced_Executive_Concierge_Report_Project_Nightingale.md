## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DECISIVE INTELLIGENCE

### Why This Report Matters Now

American Water Works faces its greatest cybersecurity crisis: your own October 2024 cyberattack that shut down billing systems for a week¹, affecting 14 million customers²; Veolia North America's January 2024 ransomware attack³; and Arkansas City's water treatment facility compromise in September 2024⁴. With AWIA mandatory assessments beginning in 2025⁵ and EPA finding critical vulnerabilities in 10% of water systems⁶, your 500+ treatment facilities⁷ and 48,000+ miles of pipeline⁸ represent the nation's most critical water infrastructure requiring immediate protection.

**Critical Context**: As America's largest water utility, American Water Works literally embodies Project Nightingale's mission - ensuring clean water for our grandchildren while supporting agricultural operations and food security across 14 states.
