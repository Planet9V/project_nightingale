## Executive Summary

Boeing Corporation's operational landscape presents compelling opportunities for the tri-partner solution across three critical dimensions: manufacturing operational technology security, supply chain protection, and regulatory compliance enhancement. With 172,000 employees operating across 94 million square feet of manufacturing facilities globally, Boeing's transformation under new leadership creates an immediate window for strategic partnership focused on operational excellence through enhanced cybersecurity.

The company's current challenges - including FAA oversight, production quality issues, and cultural transformation - align perfectly with the operational excellence positioning of NCC OTCE + Dragos + Adelard. Boeing's $6B annual investment in R&D and capital expenditures, combined with the pending $4.7B Spirit AeroSystems acquisition, demonstrates significant budget availability for solutions that enhance operational reliability and safety.
