## 2. WILDFIRE SYSTEM ATTACK VECTORS

### Weather Station Network Vulnerabilities
**Threat Intelligence Finding:** APT groups specifically researching utility weather stations
- **Attack Vector:** Internet-exposed weather stations with default credentials
- **Impact:** False weather data leading to incorrect PSPS decisions
- **2024 Incident:** Northern California utility weather network compromised
- **SCE Exposure:** 1,000+ weather stations across service territory

### Fire Detection Camera Systems
**Emerging Threat:** AI poisoning attacks on fire detection algorithms
- **Method:** Manipulating training data or real-time feeds
- **Objective:** Cause false positives/negatives in fire detection
- **Industry Alert:** "Computer Vision Systems in Critical Infrastructure" (April 2025)
- **SCE Risk:** 350+ HD cameras with AI analytics

### PSPS Decision Support Platforms
**Critical Vulnerability:** Single points of failure in decision systems
- **Attack Scenario:** Compromise modeling software during critical weather
- **Potential Impact:** Unnecessary outages or failure to de-energize
- **Threat Actor Interest:** VOLTZITE reconnaissance of similar systems
- **SCE Concern:** Integrated platform making life-safety decisions

## 3. GRID MODERNIZATION THREATS

### Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS)
**2025 Trend:** Increased targeting of grid automation platforms
- **Vulnerabilities:** Vendor remote access, unpatched systems
- **Attack Methods:** Supply chain compromise, insider threats
- **Recent Event:** Major ADMS vendor breach affecting 50+ utilities
- **SCE Impact:** Core platform for distribution operations

### Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Attacks
**Emerging Threat Vector:** Aggregated DER manipulation
- **Scale:** 2.5 million rooftop solar systems in SCE territory
- **Attack Potential:** Coordinated disconnect causing grid instability
- **2025 Research:** "GridShock" proof-of-concept demonstrated
- **SCE Vulnerability:** Limited visibility into customer-owned resources

### Smart Meter Infrastructure
**Persistent Threat:** Mass disconnect and data manipulation
- **Scope:** 5.2 million smart meters deployed
- **Recent Intelligence:** New exploit tools in underground markets
- **Attack Impact:** Mass outages, billing fraud, privacy breaches
- **SCE Consideration:** Aging AMI infrastructure with known vulnerabilities

## 4. RANSOMWARE EVOLUTION (2025)

### OT-Specific Ransomware Trends
**Key Development:** Ransomware designed for utility operations
- **SCHNEIDER**: Targets specific SCADA platforms
- **GRIDLOCK**: Focuses on substation automation
- **FIREWALL**: Attempts to disable safety systems
- **Payment Demands:** Average $15M for utilities in 2025

### Double Extortion Plus Safety
**New Tactic:** Threatening public safety to increase pressure
- **Example:** "Pay or we'll disable fire monitoring during red flag warning"
- **Legal Complexity:** Paying could violate public safety obligations
- **Insurance Gap:** Many policies exclude safety-related extortion
- **SCE Dilemma:** Balancing operational recovery with public safety

---

## 5. SUPPLY CHAIN THREATS

### Critical Vendor Compromises (2025)
Recent supply chain attacks affecting utilities:
- **Weather System Vendor:** Backdoor in firmware updates
- **SCADA Provider:** Compromise affecting 200+ utilities
- **Fire Camera Manufacturer:** State-sponsored implant discovered
- **Grid Software Platform:** Ransomware through update mechanism

### SCE-Specific Supply Chain Risks
- 200+ technology vendors with varying security standards
- Critical dependency on specialized wildfire tech vendors
- Limited visibility into vendor security practices
- Increasing vendor consolidation creating single points of failure

---

## 6. REGULATORY THREAT INTELLIGENCE

### CPUC Cybersecurity Requirements (2025)
- **New Mandate:** Real-time threat intelligence sharing
- **Enforcement:** First utility fined $5M for cyber incident reporting failure
- **Audit Focus:** Third-party risk management and OT security
- **SCE Requirement:** Demonstrate proactive threat management
