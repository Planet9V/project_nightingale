## Executive Summary

Southern California Edison (SCE), a subsidiary of Edison International (NYSE: EIX), stands at the epicenter of America's clean energy transformation while facing unprecedented cybersecurity threats from sophisticated nation-state actors. Serving 15 million Californians across a 50,000-square-mile territory that encompasses Silicon Valley's southern reaches, critical defense installations, and the nation's busiest ports, SCE operates infrastructure so vital that its compromise could trigger cascading failures across the western United States. The company's aggressive $50+ billion grid modernization program, driven by wildfire mitigation imperatives and California's net-zero mandates, has created an exponentially expanding attack surface that threat actors are actively exploiting.

Recent intelligence confirms that the Chinese state-sponsored group VOLTZITE (Volt Typhoon) has achieved persistent access within California utility networks, conducting reconnaissance and enumeration operations specifically targeting Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data that reveals critical spatial layouts of energy infrastructure. This 300+ day undetected presence pattern, combined with SCE's legacy SCADA vulnerabilities and rapid IT/OT convergence, creates conditions for potential catastrophic cyber-physical attacks that could manipulate safety systems during wildfire conditions or destabilize the grid serving America's second-largest metropolitan area.

**Critical Infrastructure at Risk:**
- **125,000 miles** of transmission and distribution lines vulnerable to cyber manipulation
- **$6.2 billion** wildfire mitigation technology deployment creating new attack vectors  
- **45%** carbon-free power delivery dependent on complex DERMS platforms with known vulnerabilities
- **10 million+** smart meters and IoT devices expanding the attack surface exponentially
- **Legacy ERP** system facing 2027 vendor support termination requiring $1.4B replacement
