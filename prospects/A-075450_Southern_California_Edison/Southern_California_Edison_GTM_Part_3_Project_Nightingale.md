## Executive Decision-Making Landscape

Southern California Edison's leadership operates under extraordinary pressure unprecedented in the utility sector. The convergence of catastrophic wildfire liability, with executives facing personal criminal prosecution risk, nation-state cyber threats actively targeting California infrastructure, and the largest grid transformation in company history creates a decision-making environment where every technology choice carries existential implications. The recent Eaton Fire lawsuits naming executives personally for alleged misrepresentation of wildfire risks has fundamentally altered how leaders approach security investments—transforming cybersecurity from technical consideration to career and freedom preservation strategy.

The leadership team, carefully constructed with deep utility and technology expertise, must navigate California's unforgiving regulatory landscape while executing a $50+ billion transformation under constant public scrutiny. The presence of former U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on the board signals recognition of cybersecurity's strategic importance, while the Safety and Operations Committee's direct oversight of cyber risks reflects hard-learned lessons from physical infrastructure failures.

**Critical Decision Dynamics:**
- **Personal Criminal Liability**: Executives face prosecution for security failures
- **Board Scrutiny**: Safety Committee reviews all technology risks monthly  
- **Regulatory Approval**: CPUC must approve all major investments
- **Public Trust**: Every decision viewed through wildfire prevention lens
- **Market Pressure**: Stock price directly correlated with safety performance
