## Executive Operational Summary

Southern California Edison's operational landscape has been fundamentally transformed by the convergence of catastrophic wildfire liability, aggressive clean energy mandates, and sophisticated nation-state cyber threats. The company operates under unprecedented scrutiny following $162.5 million in recent wildfire settlements, with the 2025 Eaton Fire generating new lawsuits and CEO Pedro Pizarro acknowledging "material losses" are probable. This operational reality has created a unique environment where cybersecurity investments directly correlate with executive criminal liability protection, insurance availability, and the company's ability to execute its $50+ billion grid modernization program.

The operational technology infrastructure supporting SCE's 125,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines represents both California's economic lifeline and its greatest vulnerability. With confirmed VOLTZITE/Volt Typhoon reconnaissance of California utilities achieving 300+ day persistence, and SCE's rapid deployment of internet-connected wildfire mitigation technologies creating thousands of new attack vectors, the company faces an existential challenge: secure the grid transformation or risk catastrophic cyber-physical incidents that could trigger wildfires, blackouts, or both.

**Critical Operational Dynamics:**
- **Wildfire Liability**: $6.2B mitigation investment with every sensor a potential attack vector
- **Grid Modernization**: 10 million smart meters, 1.5M DERs requiring secure integration  
- **Regulatory Pressure**: CPUC linking cybersecurity to rate recovery approval
- **Nation-State Threats**: Active targeting of California critical infrastructure confirmed
- **Transformation Risk**: $1.4B ERP replacement creating massive integration vulnerabilities
