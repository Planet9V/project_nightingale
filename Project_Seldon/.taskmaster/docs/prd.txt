# ETL Pipeline Implementation PRD

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive ETL Multi-Database Intelligence Pipeline for Project Seldon that processes security documents, generates embeddings, and stores data across Supabase, Pinecone, and Neo4j databases.

## Core Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation Completion (Current)
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors (currently 428 errors)
- Resolve database connection issues (Supabase timeout, Neo4j untested)
- Implement error handling framework
- Standardize logging infrastructure
- Set up basic testing framework

### Phase 2: Core Integration
- Complete Jina AI service integration for embeddings
- Implement multi-database orchestration
- Build query federation system
- Create document processing pipeline
- Add batch processing capabilities

### Phase 3: Production Features
- Implement horizontal scaling with worker pools
- Add caching layer with Redis
- Set up metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Implement health monitoring system
- Add security features (encryption, access control)

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Containerize application with Docker
- Deploy to Kubernetes
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure monitoring and alerts
- Create operational documentation

## Technical Specifications
- TypeScript/Node.js backend
- PostgreSQL via Supabase for metadata
- Pinecone for vector embeddings (768 dimensions)
- Neo4j for graph relationships
- Jina AI for embeddings and classification
- S3 for document storage
- Redis for caching
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring

## Success Criteria
- Process all 670+ Project Nightingale documents
- < 5% error rate
- < 2 second query response time
- 99.9% uptime
- 100+ documents/hour throughput
