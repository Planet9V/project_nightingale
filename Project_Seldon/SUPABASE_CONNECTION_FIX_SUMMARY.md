# Supabase Connection Timeout Fix Summary

## Task 1.2.1: Fix Supabase Timeout - COMPLETED ✅

### Date: January 14, 2025

### Changes Implemented in `/src/connectors/SupabaseConnector.ts`:

1. **Disabled Realtime for ETL**
   - Set `realtime.enabled: false` in client options
   - This reduces overhead for batch ETL operations

2. **Added Connection Timeout Headers**
   - Added `'x-connection-timeout': '30000'` (30 seconds) to global headers
   - Prevents premature timeouts during large data operations

3. **Implemented Connection Pooling**
   - Created a pool of up to 5 Supabase clients
   - Added `getPooledClient()` and `releaseClient()` methods
   - Tracks client availability with `pooledClients` Map

4. **Added Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
   - `withConnection()` method wraps all database operations
   - Default 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - Proper error logging for each retry attempt

5. **Disabled Auto-Refresh Token**
   - Set `autoRefreshToken: false` for ETL operations
   - Reduces unnecessary API calls during batch processing

6. **Updated Key Methods to Use Connection Pool**
   - `testConnection()`
   - `insertDocument()`
   - `insertDocumentsBatch()`
   - `queryDocuments()`
   - All methods now use `withConnection()` wrapper

7. **Enhanced Cleanup Method**
   - Properly clears connection pool on cleanup
   - Logs number of closed connections

### Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents connection timeouts during large ETL operations
- ✅ Improves reliability with automatic retry logic
- ✅ Better resource utilization with connection pooling
- ✅ Reduced overhead by disabling unnecessary realtime features
- ✅ More resilient to temporary network issues

### Next Steps:
- Task 1.2.2: Test Neo4j Connection
- Task 1.2.3: Test Pinecone Connection
- Continue with remaining ETL pipeline implementation tasks

### Progress Marker:
`// PROGRESS: [1.2.1] Supabase connection optimization - COMPLETED`
