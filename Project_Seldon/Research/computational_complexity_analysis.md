# Project Seldon: Computational Complexity Analysis
## Threat Prediction System for Critical Infrastructure

### Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates the computational complexity of Project Seldon's psychohistory-inspired threat prediction system, focusing on balancing accuracy with real-time performance requirements for critical infrastructure protection.

## 1. Psychohistory-Inspired Mathematical Foundations

### 1.1 Core Mathematical Framework
The system adapts Asimov's psychohistory concepts using:
- **Stochastic differential equations** for threat evolution: O(n²) for n threat vectors
- **Markov chain Monte Carlo** for probability distributions: O(k·n) where k is iterations
- **Ensemble methods** combining multiple predictive models: O(m·f(n)) where m is model count

### 1.2 Complexity Analysis
```
Base Complexity: O(n² · log n) for threat state space exploration
- n = number of monitored entities (systems, actors, vulnerabilities)
- State transitions: O(n²) pairwise interactions
- Probability calculations: O(n log n) using optimized sorting
```

### 1.3 Optimization Strategies
- **Sparse matrix representations**: Reduce O(n²) to O(n·k) where k << n
- **Hierarchical clustering**: Group similar threats, reducing effective n
- **Approximate algorithms**: Trade 5-10% accuracy for 10x speedup

## 2. Graph Algorithm Complexity for Threat Propagation

### 2.1 Attack Graph Construction
```
Graph G = (V, E) where:
- V = Infrastructure nodes + Threat actors + Vulnerabilities
- E = Potential attack paths + Dependencies

Complexity: O(|V| + |E|) ≈ O(n + n·log n) for sparse graphs
```

### 2.2 Propagation Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: O(V + E) for reachability analysis
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O((V + E) log V) for weighted threat paths
- **PageRank-style algorithms**: O(k·E) for threat influence scoring

### 2.3 Real-time Optimizations
```python
# Incremental graph updates instead of full reconstruction
def update_threat_graph(delta_events):
    # O(Δ·log n) instead of O(n²)
    affected_nodes = identify_changed_nodes(delta_events)  # O(Δ)
    update_local_subgraph(affected_nodes)  # O(Δ·log n)
    propagate_changes(affected_nodes)  # O(Δ·d) where d is avg degree
```

## 3. Vector Similarity Search Complexity

### 3.1 Threat Signature Matching
- **Brute force**: O(n·d) for n vectors of dimension d
- **KD-trees**: O(d·log n) average, O(d·n^(1-1/d)) worst case
- **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)**: O(n^ρ) where ρ < 1

### 3.2 Production Implementation
```
Using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indices:
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): O(log n) with HNSW
- Annoy (Spotify): O(log n) with random projection trees
- ScaNN (Google): O(√n) with learned quantization

Trade-off: 95% recall for 100x speedup
```

### 3.3 Scaling Considerations
```
For 10M threat signatures:
- Exact search: 10ms × 10M = 27.8 hours
- ANN search: 0.1ms × log(10M) = 2.3ms
- Batch processing: Amortize costs across multiple queries
```

## 4. Machine Learning Model Inference Times

### 4.1 Model Types and Complexity
| Model Type | Training | Inference | Memory |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Random Forest | O(n·m·log n) | O(m·h) | O(m·h) |
| Neural Networks | O(e·n·p) | O(p) | O(p) |
| Gradient Boosting | O(n·m·d) | O(m·d) | O(m·d) |
| Transformer | O(n²·d) | O(n²·d) | O(n²) |

Where: n=samples, m=trees, h=height, p=parameters, e=epochs, d=depth

### 4.2 Inference Optimization
```python
# Model quantization example
def quantize_model(model, precision=8):
    # Reduce from FP32 to INT8
    # 4x memory reduction, 2-4x speedup
    # <5% accuracy loss for most models
    return optimize_for_inference(model, precision)
```

### 4.3 Ensemble Strategy
```
Cascading ensemble for efficiency:
1. Fast linear model (1μs) filters 90% of benign events
2. Random forest (100μs) for medium complexity
3. Deep model (10ms) only for high-risk scenarios

Average latency: 0.9×1μs + 0.09×100μs + 0.01×10ms ≈ 10μs
```

## 5. Real-time vs Batch Processing Trade-offs

### 5.1 Real-time Requirements
```
Critical Infrastructure SLAs:
- Detection latency: <100ms for critical threats
- False positive rate: <0.1% to avoid alert fatigue

```
Stream Processing (Apache Flink/Spark Streaming):
- Simple rules: O(1) - immediate response
- Statistical anomalies: O(log n) - sliding windows

Batch Processing (Daily/Weekly):
- Model retraining: O(n·log n) to O(n²)
- Graph reconstruction: O(|V| + |E|)
- Historical analysis: O(n·t) where t is time range
```

        self.hash_functions = generate_hash_functions(hash_count)
    
    def add(self, threat_signature):
        # O(k) where k is hash_count
        for hash_func in self.hash_functions:
            self.bit_array[hash_func(threat_signature)] = 1
    
    def contains(self, threat_signature):
        # O(k) lookup - extremely fast
        return all(self.bit_array[hash_func(threat_signature)]
