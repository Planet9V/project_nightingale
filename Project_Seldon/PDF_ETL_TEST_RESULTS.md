   - Ready to receive embeddings

### ❌ Failed Components (2/6)

1. **Jina API** ❌
   - Status: 402 Payment Required
   - Issue: Paid plan not yet activated
   - Model: jina-clip-v2 (768 dimensions)

2. **Supabase** ❌

ALERT
CISA Adds Five Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog
Release Date: June 02, 2025

Vulnerabilities added:
- CVE-2021-32030: ASUS Routers Improper Authentication
- CVE-2023-39780: ASUS RT-AX55 OS Command Injection
- CVE-2024-56145: Craft CMS Code Injection
- CVE-2025-3935: ConnectWise ScreenConnect Path Traversal
- CVE-2025-3956: Zenml Path Traversal
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Activate Jina Paid Plan
- Visit: https://jina.ai/dashboard
- Activate billing for API key
- Test with: `node src/scripts/test-jina-clip.js`

### 2. Fix Supabase Connection
```bash
# Test connection
curl -X GET https://czkpqbylcezgquaujjlq.supabase.co/rest/v1/ \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Check network/firewall
ping czkpqbylcezgquaujjlq.supabase.co
```

### 3. Run Full Pipeline
Once both issues are fixed:
```bash
# Process single PDF
node test-pdf-etl.js

# Process all PDFs in directory
npm run etl -- \
  --input Current_advisories_2025_7_1 \
  --file-pattern "\.pdf$" \
  --max-files 5

# Process all 2023 security reports
npm run etl -- \
  --input intelligence/external_sources/awesome_annual_reports/Annual\ Security\ Reports/2023 \
  --file-pattern "\.pdf$"
```

## Component Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| MCP Services | ✅ | Context7, SuperMemory, Knowledge Graph all operational |
| PDF Parser | ✅ | pdf-parse installed and working |
| Text Processing | ✅ | Extraction and chunking functional |
| Jina API | ❌ | Awaiting paid plan activation |
| Pinecone | ✅ | nightingale index ready (768d) |
| Supabase | ❌ | Connection timeout issues |
| Neo4j | ❓ | Not tested yet |
| S3 Storage | ❓ | Not configured yet |

## Performance Metrics

- **PDF Parsing**: ~100ms for 150KB file
- **Text Extraction**: Immediate
- **Chunking**: ~10ms for 4 chunks
- **Expected Embedding Time**: ~2s per batch (once Jina active)
- **Expected Total Processing**: ~5s per PDF

---

**Conclusion**: PDF processing pipeline is 67% ready. Only blockers are Jina API payment and Supabase connection.
