\# EMB3D Threat Modeling Technique

EMB3D (Energy Modeling Based on Three Dimensions) is a specialized threat modeling technique focused specifically on energy sector operational technology environments. Unlike more general threat modeling frameworks, EMB3D is tailored to address the unique challenges and attack vectors found in energy infrastructure.

The three dimensions typically referenced in EMB3D include:

1\. Physical Infrastructure: Modeling threats to physical energy assets such as generation facilities, transmission equipment, distribution systems, and microgrids.    
      
2\. Control Systems: Analyzing vulnerabilities in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and other industrial control systems unique to energy operations.    
        
3\. Energy Flow Management: Examining threats that could disrupt or manipulate the generation, transmission, and distribution of energy, including attacks that could cause grid instability.  

EMB3D is particularly valuable for Endeavor Energy because:

\- It's designed specifically for energy sector vulnerability analysis  
\- It considers the interconnected nature of modern energy grids and distributed energy resources  
\- It accounts for both cyber and physical attack vectors  
\- It helps identify cascading failure scenarios unique to energy infrastructure  
\- It aligns well with energy sector regulatory requirements

When combined with MITRE ATT\&CK framework (which catalogs general attack techniques), EMB3D provides comprehensive coverage of the threat landscape specific to Endeavor's operations, especially regarding critical infrastructure like microgrids and community battery systems.

Would you like me to provide more specific information about how EMB3D would be applied to Endeavor's systems during the assessment?
