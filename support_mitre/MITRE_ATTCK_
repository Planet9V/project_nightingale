# 3. Deep Dive: Researching Occurrences, Threat Actors, and Ransomware Groups with ATT&CK
The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides rich, structured data that is invaluable for researching specific cyber occurrences, understanding threat actor modus operandi, and analyzing ransomware group behaviors. By leveraging the Groups, Software, and technique details within ATT&CK, analysts can build comprehensive profiles and gain actionable intelligence.

## 3.1. Leveraging the ATT&CK Groups Database for Actor Profiling
The "Groups" section of the MITRE ATT&CK website serves as a comprehensive encyclopedia of known cyber threat actors and activity clusters.12 Each entry, such as for FIN7 (G0046) or APT29 (G0016), provides a detailed profile that typically includes 12:
Associated Names/Aliases: Different security vendors and researchers often track the same activity under various names. ATT&CK collates these, aiding in cross-referencing intelligence reports (e.g., FIN7 is associated with Carbanak Group by some reporting, though ATT&CK distinguishes them).12
Suspected Origin and Motivation: Information on likely attribution (e.g., nation-state, cybercriminal) and primary drivers (e.g., espionage, financial gain).12
Activity Timeline: The period during which the group has been observed to be active.
Targeting: Typical industries, geographic regions, or types of organizations targeted by the group. For example, FIN7 has historically targeted retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors.13

Notable Campaigns and Operations: References to specific high-profile attacks or campaigns attributed to the group.

Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs): A list of ATT&CK techniques commonly employed by the group. FIN7, for instance, is known for techniques like Phishing (T1566), Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486), and Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059).13
Software Used: Malware and tools frequently associated with the group's operations.
This structured information is critical for actor profiling. When investigating an incident potentially linked to a known group, or when conducting proactive threat hunting, this database allows analysts to understand an adversary's typical playbook, anticipate their likely next moves, and tailor defenses accordingly.12 The EAB-018 report, while not attributing the specific incident to a named ATT&CK group, discusses the "Hive Ransomware-as-a-Service platform" and importantly notes that "Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP's) are copied from one group to another".7 This highlights that even if direct attribution is elusive, understanding common TTPs used by ransomware groups is still highly valuable.

The "Associated Groups" feature and the acknowledgment that group definitions can sometimes overlap or differ between reporting sources underscore the fluid and complex nature of the threat landscape.12 Adversary groups may share tools, infrastructure, or personnel, or one group might evolve or splinter into new entities. This means that analysts should treat attributions as dynamic hypotheses based on clustered activity rather than immutable facts. A rigid focus on a single group name might lead to missed connections or an underestimation of an evolving threat. The observation in EAB-018 about TTPs being copied further reinforces the need for a broad understanding of techniques prevalent within certain classes of attacks (like ransomware) rather than solely relying on specific group profiles.

The detailed TTPs listed for each group within the ATT&CK knowledge base enable organizations to perform targeted threat modeling.12 If an organization's profile (e.g., industry, geography) aligns with the typical targets of a specific ATT&CK group, security teams can proactively review that group's known TTPs and assess their defensive posture against those specific behaviors. For example, a financial institution might prioritize defenses against techniques commonly used by financially motivated actors like FIN7, such as point-of-sale malware deployment or specific phishing strategies.13 This focused approach, guided by threat intelligence, is generally more effective and 
resource-efficient than attempting to defend against all possible TTPs equally.

## 3.2. Utilizing the ATT&CK Software Database for Tool and Malware Analysis
Parallel to the Groups database, the "Software" section of the ATT&CK website catalogs both malicious software (Malware) and legitimate software (Tools) that adversaries are known to use.14 The EAB-018 report identifies several such software instances, including legitimate tools like Advanced IP Scanner, ADfind, Rclone, and AnyDesk, as well as tools often associated with malicious activity like Cobalt Strike and the Chisel backdoor.7
Each software entry in the ATT&CK database provides 14:
ID and Name: A unique ATT&CK ID (e.g., S0154 for Cobalt Strike) and its common name.
Associated Software/Aliases: Other names by which the software is known.
Type and Description: Whether it's a backdoor, ransomware, remote access tool, command-line interface, etc., along with its primary functionalities, programming language, and capabilities.

Associated Groups: Threat actors known to employ this software.
ATT&CK Techniques Implemented: The specific techniques the software facilitates.
Identifying the software used by an adversary is a crucial piece of intelligence. The ATT&CK Software database helps analysts understand a tool's capabilities, its common usage patterns by threat actors, and how it maps to specific adversary behaviors. This knowledge directly informs the development of detection signatures, behavioral analytics, and mitigation strategies.

The distinction made in ATT&CK between "Tool" and "Malware" is particularly significant.14 Many entries categorized as "Tools" are legitimate system administration utilities or commercially available software that adversaries abuse for malicious purposes—a concept often referred to as "Living Off the Land" (LOTL). The EAB-018 report provides clear examples of this, detailing the misuse of RDP for remote access, Advanced IP Scanner and ADfind for discovery, Rclone for data exfiltration, and AnyDesk for persistence.7 Because these tools have legitimate applications, their mere presence on a system is not indicative of malicious activity. Therefore, detection strategies cannot solely rely on identifying known malicious files by hash. Instead, security teams must develop more sophisticated detection mechanisms focused on the anomalous usage of these legitimate tools, such as unusual command-line parameters, network connections to suspicious destinations, or execution by unexpected parent processes. This is a core tenet of behavior-based threat detection.

Furthermore, the "Associated Software" field in the ATT&CK database and the common adversary practice of renaming tools to evade detection (e.g., Rclone renamed to svchost.exe and Chisel to finder.exe in EAB-018 7) highlight the limitations of detection methods based solely on filenames or simple file hashes. Adversaries can easily alter these attributes. Consequently, more resilient detection mechanisms are required. These include analyzing process command-line arguments, monitoring network traffic patterns associated with tool execution, examining API call sequences, or employing more robust signatures that identify intrinsic characteristics of the tool's code or behavior, regardless of its apparent name.

## 3.3. Mapping Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) to Adversary TTPs
Vulnerabilities, identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers, are frequently exploited by adversaries to gain initial access to systems or to escalate privileges within a compromised network. The EAB-018 report clearly illustrates this by detailing the exploitation of CVE-2022-35405, a vulnerability in ManageEngine Password Manager Pro, which allowed the adversary to achieve initial access.7 This exploitation directly maps to the ATT&CK technique T1190 "Exploit Public-Facing Application." Similarly, threat actor profiles within ATT&CK, such as that for FIN7, often list specific CVEs they have been observed exploiting, like CVE-2021-31207 in Microsoft Exchange or CVE-2020-1472 (ZeroLogon).13 Techniques such as T1068 "Exploitation for Privilege Escalation" also directly relate to the leveraging of CVEs for gaining higher-level permissions.7

Connecting specific CVEs to the ATT&CK techniques they enable provides a powerful framework for prioritizing vulnerability management efforts. Instead of relying solely on generic severity scores like CVSS, organizations can use ATT&CK to understand which vulnerabilities are being actively exploited by threat actors relevant to their industry or region. By cross-referencing CVE information with TTPs commonly used by pertinent threat groups (identified from the ATT&CK Groups database or external CTI reporting), organizations can focus their patching and mitigation resources on the vulnerabilities that pose the most immediate and realistic threat. This threat-informed approach optimizes resource allocation and strengthens defenses against likely attack vectors.
The landscape of vulnerabilities and their exploitation is constantly evolving. New CVEs are disclosed regularly, and threat actors continuously research and develop exploits for them. As seen with the 2022 CVE exploited in the EAB-018 incident in early 2023 7 and the range of CVEs exploited by FIN7 over several years 18, adversaries are quick to incorporate new and old vulnerabilities into their arsenals. This dynamic means that the mapping of CVEs to ATT&CK TTPs is an ongoing process. Static lists of these mappings will quickly become outdated. Therefore, security teams require access to continuous, up-to-date threat intelligence feeds—from security vendors, government agencies like CISA, or information sharing communities—that provide current information on which CVEs are being actively weaponized and which ATT&CK techniques these exploits facilitate. This allows for timely adjustments to defensive postures and patching priorities.
