## **Overview of the Energy Sector and OT/ICS**

Operational Technology (OT) encompasses the hardware and software that monitor and control physical processes, such as those involved in power generation and distribution. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a broader term that includes OT and systems like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS), which automate the operations of power plants, substations, and grid management systems 1. Historically, OT systems operated in relative isolation, often referred to as air-gapped environments, which provided a degree of inherent security. However, the drive for increased efficiency, remote monitoring capabilities, and integration with enterprise IT systems has led to a significant convergence of these previously distinct environments 2. This integration, while offering numerous operational benefits, has unfortunately also expanded the attack surface, exposing OT systems to a wider range of cyber threats 3. Unlike IT systems with shorter refresh cycles, OT equipment often has a lifespan of 15 to 20 years or even longer, which can lead to the use of legacy systems that were not designed with modern cybersecurity threats in mind and may lack the ability to be easily updated or patched 4.

In **power generation** facilities, a variety of interconnected OT/ICS technologies are employed to optimize electricity production 1. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a central role, enabling real-time monitoring and control of remote equipment such as transformers and circuit breakers, providing operators with a visual interface to track grid performance and respond to anomalies 1. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are specialized computers that control processes within power plants and substations, interfacing with SCADA systems to automate operations and ensure the correct functioning of equipment like generators and transformers 1. Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) provide operators with graphical representations of system data, alarms, and controls, facilitating quick decision-making and action in case of malfunctions 1. Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) are used in remote locations to collect data from sensors and transmit this information back to SCADA systems for centralized monitoring and control 1. These systems rely on various communication protocols such as DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850 to facilitate the exchange of data between field devices and central control systems, ensuring seamless operation 1. Critical operational data is often stored in data historians, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting, performance analysis, and identifying trends 1. To protect these systems, security components like firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions are implemented 1. Redundancy and fail-safe mechanisms are also crucial to ensure operational reliability in case of component failures 1.

**Power transmission** networks, which often span large geographical areas, heavily depend on OT/ICS for monitoring high-voltage transmission lines and ensuring the stable flow of electricity 1. Similar to power generation, SCADA systems are vital for the real-time monitoring and control of remote equipment in transmission networks, including transformers and circuit breakers in substations 1. PLCs are also utilized within substations to control localized processes 1. Operators interact with these systems through HMIs, and RTUs are deployed to gather data from remote locations and transmit it to the central SCADA system 1. The same suite of communication protocols, such as DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, are used to facilitate data exchange across the geographically dispersed infrastructure 1. The security of these transmission systems is paramount due to the wide-ranging impact any disruption could have on the electricity grid 1.

**Power distribution** systems are responsible for ensuring that substations effectively distribute power to residential and commercial consumers 1. This segment of the energy sector is increasingly incorporating smart grid technologies, leading to a more complex and interconnected infrastructure 5. Remote management and monitoring capabilities are becoming more prevalent, allowing for greater efficiency and responsiveness 5. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are the backbone of this critical infrastructure, encompassing the processes that generate, transmit, and distribute electricity 7. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are also essential for monitoring the uninterrupted functionality of power plant OT and for sounding alarms in case of security breaches 5. The blending of IT and OT in power plants has fundamentally shifted the security landscape, making power distribution a target for cyber threats with potentially widespread consequences 5.

GRAPHITE's activities have been observable since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with a focus on organizations relevant to the military conflict 44. The group has been identified conducting spear-phishing campaigns targeting hydroelectric generation and natural gas pipeline operators and facilities, as well as near-constant phishing operations using known vulnerabilities and custom script-based malware to target organizations in critical industries 47. GRAPHITE initially relied on compromised Ubiquiti Edge Routers networks for distributing malware and maintaining command-and-control (C2) operations but shifted to using legitimate internet services after a U.S.-led takedown of their botnet in early 2024 44. The group is capable of Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain, indicating intelligence-gathering capabilities that could enable future cyber operations against industrial targets 52. GRAPHITE has been known to exploit vulnerabilities such as CVE-2023-23397 (Microsoft Outlook) and CVE-2023-38831 (WinRAR) 54.

### **VOLTZITE**

VOLTZITE is considered a crucial threat group to track in critical infrastructure due to its dedicated focus on OT data 44. This group shares extensive technical overlaps with the Volt Typhoon threat group tracked by other organizations, which has been attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors 44. VOLTZITE has been observed performing reconnaissance and enumeration of multiple U.S.-based electric companies since early 2023, and has also targeted emergency management services, telecommunications, satellite services, and defense industrial bases 44. The group utilizes the same techniques as in previous years, setting up complex chains of network infrastructure, often leveraging compromised small office and home office (SOHO) network equipment, to target, compromise, and steal compromising OT-relevant data—such as GIS data, OT network diagrams, and operating instructions—from victim ICS organizations 44. VOLTZITE heavily uses living off the land (LOTL) techniques, which can make detection and response efforts more difficult 44. The group has been observed exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing VPN appliances or firewalls for initial access 44, including CVE-2022-42475 in FortiGate firewalls 62. VOLTZITE's actions towards U.S. electric entities, telecommunications, and GIS systems signify clear objectives to identify vulnerabilities within the country's critical infrastructure that can be exploited in the future for destructive or disruptive cyber attacks 44.

## **Potential Targets for Endeavor Energy**

Based on the analysis of common energy sector technologies, key suppliers, partners, and the targeting patterns of BAUXITE, GRAPHITE, and VOLTZITE, several potential targets are relevant to Endeavor Energy.

Given the focus of all three threat groups on the energy sector and OT/ICS environments, Endeavor Energy should prioritize securing its **internet-facing OT/ICS assets**. This includes SCADA/HMI systems, PLCs, and any other industrial control devices that are directly accessible from the internet. The communication protocols used by these systems should be carefully reviewed to ensure they are properly configured and monitored for any anomalous activity. Systems with weak authentication mechanisms or lacking encryption are particularly vulnerable 62.

Endeavor Energy's reliance on the identified **major OT/ICS hardware and software suppliers** (Rockwell Automation, Emerson, GE Vernova, Honeywell, ABB, Siemens, Schneider Electric, and OT security vendors like Nozomi Networks, Industrial Defender, Dragos, Claroty) also presents potential targets. Vulnerabilities discovered in the products or services of these suppliers could have a widespread impact. Therefore, Endeavor Energy should closely monitor security advisories released by these vendors and establish a process for the rapid implementation of patches and mitigations.

## **Known Vulnerabilities and Common Attack Vectors**

Several known vulnerabilities and common attack vectors are relevant to the threat posed by BAUXITE, GRAPHITE, and VOLTZITE to Endeavor Energy. Weak authentication mechanisms, such as default or easily guessable passwords, particularly on internet-exposed OT/ICS devices like PLCs and HMIs, are a significant point of weakness that BAUXITE has actively exploited 44. The lack of encryption in communication protocols used by some OT/ICS systems can also allow attackers to intercept and potentially manipulate data 1. Unpatched firmware and software on OT/ICS devices and network appliances create entry points that GRAPHITE and VOLTZITE have been known to target, including specific CVEs like CVE-2023-23397 (Outlook), CVE-2023-38831 (WinRAR), and CVE-2022-42475 (FortiGate) 44.

Common attack vectors observed include spear-phishing campaigns, which GRAPHITE frequently uses to steal credentials or deliver malware 44. Exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities in internet-facing network appliances like firewalls, VPNs, and routers is a favored initial access method for VOLTZITE 44. The use of "living off the land" (LOTL) techniques by VOLTZITE allows them to blend their malicious activity with legitimate system processes, making detection challenging 44. Additionally, the compromise of third-party partners with access to Endeavor Energy's systems or data presents a significant risk, as their vulnerabilities could be leveraged by these threat groups to gain unauthorized entry 70.

## **Conclusion**

The threat landscape facing the energy sector is increasingly complex and dangerous, with sophisticated threat groups like BAUXITE, GRAPHITE, and VOLTZITE actively targeting critical infrastructure. Endeavor Energy must adopt a proactive and layered security approach to effectively mitigate these risks. By focusing on securing internet-exposed OT/ICS assets, strengthening supply chain security, enhancing network monitoring capabilities, and implementing robust incident response plans, Endeavor Energy can significantly improve its resilience against these persistent and evolving threats. Continuous monitoring of the threat landscape and adaptation of security measures are essential to stay ahead of these determined adversaries.
