# Dragos Briefing for NCC Account Managers {#dragos-briefing-for-ncc-account-managers}

## 1\. Executive Summary

Dragos is the leader in cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) environments. They protect critical infrastructure – the systems that run energy, manufacturing, water, and other essential services. Unlike IT-focused security companies, Dragos is built *specifically* for OT. Their platform provides visibility, threat detection, and vulnerability management, and their team has unmatched experience responding to real-world industrial cyberattacks. This partnership allows NCC Group to offer best-in-class OT security to your clients, addressing a critical and growing need.

## 2\. Company Background & Culture

* **Founding & Mission:** Founded in 2016 by former US government and allied nation cybersecurity experts who investigated major ICS attacks (including the Ukraine power grid attacks). Their mission is "Safeguarding Civilization" by protecting industrial infrastructure.

* **Expertise:** The founders (Robert M. Lee, Jon Lavender, Justin Cavinee) have deep roots in the US intelligence community (NSA, Air Force) with direct experience in ICS/SCADA threat intelligence and incident response. This isn't just theory for them; they've been on the front lines.

* **Culture:** Dragos has a strong culture of:

  * **Mission-Driven:** A genuine commitment to protecting critical infrastructure.

  * **Expertise-Led:** Decisions and solutions are driven by deep OT knowledge.

  * **Community-Focused:** They believe in collective defense (Neighborhood Keeper program).

  * **Pragmatic:** They focus on practical, actionable solutions, not just technology.

## 3\. Key Differentiators (vs. IT Security Vendors & OT Competitors)

| Differentiator | Description | Why it Matters to NCC Clients |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| OT-Native Expertise | Built *specifically* for industrial environments, not adapted from IT solutions. Understands industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3, etc.), processes, and constraints. | Avoids false positives and disruptions common with IT tools in OT. Provides accurate, actionable insights. Reduces risk of operational downtime. |
| Threat Intelligence | Dragos WorldView provides OT-specific threat intelligence, tracking 23+ threat groups (like VOLTZITE, GRAPHITE, BAUXITE) that target industrial systems. Includes the OT-CERT, providing free resources and critical vulnerability notifications. | Provides early warning of threats *before* they impact your clients. Allows proactive defense, not just reactive response. Access to information not found in generic threat feeds. |
| "Now/Next/Never" | A vulnerability prioritization framework specifically for OT. Focuses on *actual* risk and operational impact, not just CVSS scores. | Helps clients prioritize remediation efforts effectively, minimizing disruption and focusing on the most critical vulnerabilities. Avoids wasting resources on low-impact issues. |
| Community Defense | Neighborhood Keeper program allows anonymous, collective threat intelligence sharing across industries and geographies. | Provides broader visibility into the threat landscape and early warning of emerging threats. Leverages the collective knowledge of the industrial community. |
| Response Playbooks | Expert-authored playbooks for responding to ICS-specific incidents, based on real-world experience. | Reduces response time and improves effectiveness during incidents. Provides clear, step-by-step guidance for OT-specific threats (like ransomware targeting PLCs). |
| ICS Cyber Kill Chain | Dragos has a deep understanding of how adversaries attack industrial systems, allowing them to detect and disrupt threats at multiple stages. | Provides a more comprehensive and effective defense than solutions that only focus on perimeter security or anomaly detection. |
