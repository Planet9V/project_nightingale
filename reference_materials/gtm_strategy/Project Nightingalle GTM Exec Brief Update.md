## 2. Strategic Imperatives & Approach

Project Nightingale is built on several core pillars designed for maximum impact and scalability:

### Americas Leading the Charge
The Americas region will spearhead this initiative, establishing a replicable model for global rollout. This allows for focused execution and refinement before expansion.

### Power of Partnerships -- A Triumvirate of Expertise

#### Dragos Partnership
Leveraging their leading OT threat intelligence and platform for enhanced detection and response capabilities within our offerings. This includes:
- Account swap agreement to tap into high-value energy sector prospects
- **Dragos Platform:** Unparalleled asset visibility through passive monitoring
- **Dragos WorldView:** OT-specific threat intelligence delivery
- **Dragos OT Retainer:** Specialized incident response services

#### Adelard Partnership
Fully integrating Adelard's deep safety case knowledge and ASCE platform. This allows us to address the converging worlds of cybersecurity and operational safety through:
- Deterministic verification methodologies
- Regulatory compliance expertise
- Formal safety assessment capabilities
- Key differentiator and client demand, especially in critical infrastructure

#### NCC IT Assurance Services
Seamlessly incorporating relevant NCC IT service lines to provide comprehensive IT/OT security solutions, addressing the full spectrum of client digital risk through our technology-agnostic consulting approach.

### Combined Partnership Value
This three-way partnership delivers a comprehensive approach to operational technology security and safety that enhances reliability rather than compromising it. Clients benefit from:
- Strategic guidance
- Tactical implementation support
- Specialized technology
- Safety case development
- Regulatory compliance expertise
- Ongoing managed services

All delivered with an engineering-led mindset that puts operations first. Our unique combination provides **40% faster compliance achievement**, **zero-impact assessment methodologies**, and the only solution in the market that mathematically verifies safety-critical functions while maintaining security posture.

### Focus on High-Value, Specialized Services
The campaign prioritizes nine distinct service themes addressing critical operational reliability and safety challenges, with initial emphasis on two high-impact areas:

#### Initial Focus Areas

**Ransomware Impact Assessment:** Preventing operational downtime and revenue loss through targeted defense strategies that ensure continuous delivery of essential services, with integrated safety impact analysis of ransomware scenarios and safety function isolation strategies.

**M&A Due Diligence:** Avoiding post-acquisition surprises and securing accurate valuation through comprehensive assessment that protects reliability during organizational transitions, including safety certification validation and safety case integration assessment.

## Integrated Sales & Technical Execution

**Marketing Note:** *would like to work in with this*

### Tight Alignment
Fostering deep collaboration between Sales Account Managers (AMs) and OTCE Engineers. AMs will own the client relationship and translate value, while OTCE Engineers (supported by Adelard and Dragos experts) will deliver technical depth and customized solutions through structured 15-minute expert consultations.

### Clear Roles & Responsibilities
Defined engagement processes and responsibilities ensure a smooth client journey from initial outreach to opportunity development, supported by:
- Comprehensive pre-call preparation
- Personalized briefing documents
- Structured follow-up protocols

### Data-Driven, Targeted Marketing

#### Three-Stage Content Approach
Progressive value delivery through:
1. **OSINT Discovery Reports** (intelligence foundation)
2. **Threat Analysis Reports** (sector-specific vulnerability assessment)
3. **Full Concierge Reports** (comprehensive assessment with operational reliability focus)

#### Marketing Landing Pages & Concierge Reports
Utilizing dedicated landing pages for each campaign theme, offering high-value, gated "Full Concierge Reports" (synthesizing OSINT and threat analysis) to convert prospects, with integrated scheduling for expert consultations.

#### Analytics-Driven Prospecting
Leveraging analytics from the North America Sales team to identify and prioritize high-value prospects through the **50/50 account swap program**:
- 50 Dragos clients → NCC services
- 50 NCC clients → Dragos platform

The campaign will initially target these key accounts, followed by a phased expansion to "stale" or under-engaged customers.

### Modular & Scalable Global Model
The campaign is designed with a modular approach, allowing for adaptation and replication across other regions. Following the Americas launch, a fast-follow is planned for ANZ, with EMEA and other regions to follow suit, leveraging the refined playbook and learnings from the four-phase implementation timeline (Preparation, Content Development, Campaign Launch, Expansion & Optimization).

## 4. Key Risks & Mitigation

**Execution Complexity:** Integrating multiple service lines and partner contributions requires strong program management.  
*Mitigation:* Clear roles, defined processes, and dedicated campaign leadership (Jim McKenney, Paul Kingsbury, Matt Field).

**Regional Adaptation:** Ensuring the model translates effectively to other regions.  
*Mitigation:* Modular design and phased rollout with continuous feedback loops.

**Maintaining Consistent Messaging:** Ensuring all client-facing teams articulate the integrated value proposition clearly.  
*Mitigation:* Comprehensive training, standardized sales materials, and clear guides for AMs and Engineers.

### Success Gates

- **Phase 1 completion:** Template development and team readiness (Week 2)
- **Phase 2 milestone:** 20 target accounts with completed intelligence reports (Week 3)
- **Phase 3 checkpoint:** ?+ scheduled consultations and initial pipeline development (Week 10)
- **Phase 3 checkpoint:** Expanded to additional "stale or other opportunities (~100 or so)
- **Expand to other regions:** TBD

Project Nightingale positions NCC Group to dominate the converging cybersecurity-safety market while delivering the operational reliability that ensures essential services for future generations. Executive approval enables immediate launch with measurable impact within 90 days.

These six improvements add quantified targets, clear metrics, investment framework, success gates, and stronger opening/closing while maintaining the document's structure. They can be implemented in 15-20 minutes and significantly enhance executive appeal and decision-making clarity.
