# Project Nightingale: Prospect Theme Classification System
## Service Theme Assignment Framework

**Created**: June 6, 2025  
**Purpose**: Enable precise prospect targeting through service theme specialization  
**Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible with existing 611 artifacts  
**Enhancement**: Additive classification system - no breaking changes

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **THEME CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **9 Available Service Themes**

#### **âœ… IMPLEMENTED (Phase 1) - Universal Coverage**
All existing 611 artifacts include these themes as baseline:
1. **Ransomware Impact Assessment** [`RIA`] - Operational downtime prevention
2. **M&A Due Diligence** [`M&A`] - Post-acquisition security validation

#### **ðŸš€ READY FOR SPECIALIZATION (Phase 2)**
3. **Supply Chain Vulnerability** [`SCV`] - Third-party risk & component security
4. **IEC 62443 Compliance** [`IEC`] - Accelerated certification & regulatory alignment
5. **IT/OT Convergence Security** [`ITC`] - Digital transformation security
6. **Legacy Codebase Risk** [`LCR`] - SBOM analysis & modernization roadmaps
7. **Product Lifecycle Monitoring** [`PLM`] - Continuous vulnerability tracking
8. **Safety Case Analysis** [`SCA`] - Critical infrastructure safety-security integration
9. **Network Visibility & Compliance** [`NVC`] - Segmentation validation & monitoring

## ðŸ”§ **IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY**

### **For New Prospects**
```bash
# 1. Create prospect theme file
echo "PRIMARY_THEME: Supply Chain Vulnerability (SCV)" > prospects/A-XXXXX_Company/PROSPECT_THEME.md
echo "SECONDARY_THEME: IT/OT Convergence Security (ITC)" >> prospects/A-XXXXX_Company/PROSPECT_THEME.md
echo "BASELINE_THEMES: Ransomware Impact Assessment (RIA), M&A Due Diligence (M&A)" >> prospects/A-XXXXX_Company/PROSPECT_THEME.md

# 2. Apply enhanced templates
# Use: templates/PROJECT_NIGHTINGALE_ENHANCED_TEMPLATES.md (baseline)
# Plus: templates/service_themes/SCV_supply_chain_vulnerability.md (specialization)

# 3. Generate theme-enhanced artifacts
# Standard 10 artifacts with theme-specific enhancement modules
```

### **For Existing Prospects (Optional Enhancement)**
```bash
# 1. Assign retrospective theme based on industry/profile
# 2. Create PROSPECT_THEME.md file for future reference
# 3. Optionally enhance existing artifacts with theme specialization
# 4. Maintain 100% backward compatibility
```

### **Theme Enhancement Commands**
```bash
# Quick theme assignment for new prospect
classify_prospect() {
    COMPANY="$1"
    INDUSTRY="$2"
    echo "Classifying $COMPANY in $INDUSTRY..."
    # Run classification logic
}

# Theme-specific artifact generation
generate_themed_artifacts() {
    PROSPECT_DIR="$1"
    PRIMARY_THEME="$2"
    echo "Generating $PRIMARY_THEME specialized artifacts for $PROSPECT_DIR..."
    # Apply theme-specific templates
}
```
