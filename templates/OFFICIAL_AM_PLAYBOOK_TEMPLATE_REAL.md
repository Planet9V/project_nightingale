This template becomes effective only when fully customized with territory-specific information and actual prospect intelligence. Complete customization ensures credible, value-focused conversations that differentiate our approach from traditional cybersecurity vendors.

1. **MANDATORY COMPLETE PROSPECT COVERAGE**: Every assigned prospect MUST have a full detailed profile section. No placeholders like "[Continue with detailed profile...]" are permitted.
2. **RESEARCH DATA INTEGRATION MANDATE**: All contact information must be actual names, emails, and company details extracted from research files. When contact details are missing from research files, use web search tools (WebSearch, mcp__brave__brave_web_search, mcp__tavily__tavily-search) to find actual contact information. Only use "Contact information unavailable - requires additional research" when web searches fail to locate details.
3. **QUICK REFERENCE REQUIREMENT**: Include summary table with key contacts, priorities, and talking points for rapid prospect review.
4. **ENHANCED TL-DR FORMAT**: Standardize executive summary format with leadership team, key locations, and recent events for all prospects.
5. **CAMPAIGN THEME ALIGNMENT**: All prospects must align to Ransomware Impact Assessment and M&A Due Diligence themes only.
6. **INTELLIGENT CONTACT RESEARCH**: Verify all contact information through latest 400-600 line research files and supplement with systematic web search intelligence gathering when contact details are incomplete. Use WebSearch, mcp__brave__brave_web_search, and mcp__tavily__tavily-search tools to find missing emails, direct phone numbers, and current titles. Follow the Intelligent Contact Lookup Methodology outlined in the Professional Standards section.
