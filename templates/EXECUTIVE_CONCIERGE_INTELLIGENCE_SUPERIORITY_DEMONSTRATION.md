## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION DEMONSTRATION

### **SCENARIO 1: EXECUTIVE BRIEFING COMPARISON**

#### **Traditional Competitor Executive Briefing:**
"Your organization faces cybersecurity threats from advanced persistent threats targeting critical infrastructure. We recommend implementing security controls and monitoring to protect against attacks. Industry reports show data breaches cost an average of $4.88M."

#### **NCC Group + Dragos + Adelard Executive Briefing:**
"ELECTRUM threat actors (GRU Unit 26165) conducted reconnaissance against ComEd SCADA networks in Q1 2025, with your Schneider Electric systems matching their targeting profile. Duke Energy faced $12.4M recovery costs from similar campaigns, while your 10.7M customer records represent $21.4M dark web value. SANDWORM's FrostyGoop malware specifically targets your 247 Schneider Electric protection systems, with proven grid disruption capability affecting millions during peak winter demand. NERC CIP compliance gaps create $1M+ daily penalty exposure during investigation."

**Executive Response Difference:**
- **Competitor:** "Send us a proposal for your services"
- **NCC Group:** "We need to meet immediately - how do they know this about our systems?"

### **SCENARIO 2: TECHNICAL TEAM ENGAGEMENT COMPARISON**

#### **Traditional Competitor Technical Analysis:**
"Vulnerability assessment identified several high-priority vulnerabilities requiring patching. We recommend implementing network segmentation and monitoring solutions to improve security posture."

#### **NCC Group + Dragos + Adelard Technical Analysis:**
"CVE-2024-12345 in your Schneider Electric ADMS creates SANDWORM FrostyGoop exploitation capability, with 14 utility attacks within 30 days of disclosure. Your 247 protection systems require emergency patching within 7 days to prevent grid manipulation capability. ELECTRUM custom exploits for CVE-2024-12346 were observed in ComEd reconnaissance, with 14-30 day timeline from initial access to grid manipulation. Network segmentation must isolate your 23 IT/OT convergence points where VOLTZITE deploys cryptocurrency mining before lateral movement to operational networks."

**Technical Team Response Difference:**
- **Competitor:** "We'll review your recommendations and get back to you"
- **NCC Group:** "We need emergency patching resources and immediate security enhancement"

### **SCENARIO 3: FINANCIAL JUSTIFICATION COMPARISON**

#### **Traditional Competitor Business Case:**
"Cybersecurity investment provides protection against threats and reduces risk. Industry benchmarks show positive ROI for security investments."

#### **NCC Group + Dragos + Adelard Business Case:**
"$12.4M VOLTZITE recovery costs at Duke Energy vs $247K monthly MXDR investment = 50:1 ROI. Your $1M+ daily NERC CIP penalty exposure vs $89K compliance acceleration = 11:1 first-month ROI. ELECTRUM grid manipulation preventing $2.3B economic impact (Ukrainian precedent) vs $1.7M annual tri-partner program = 1,353:1 catastrophic event prevention ROI. SANDWORM FrostyGoop affecting 2.4M customers during winter peak demand vs $423K emergency response capability = immediate business continuity protection."

**Financial Leadership Response Difference:**
- **Competitor:** "The numbers make sense, but we need to budget for next year"
- **NCC Group:** "We need emergency budget approval - the financial exposure is unacceptable"
