## ðŸŽ¯ **CONTENT PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM**

### **Sector-Specific Personalization Logic**

#### **Energy Sector Personalization**
```
Industry Detection:
IF: Company domain contains "electric|utility|power|energy"
OR: Industry classification = "Utilities"
THEN: Deploy Energy Sector Intelligence Sequence

Variable Replacement:
{SECTOR_THREAT_STAT_1} = "78% increase in energy sector targeting (Mandiant M-Trends 2024)"
{SECTOR_FINANCIAL_IMPACT} = "$14.7M average incident cost for utilities (IBM 2024)"
{THREAT_ACTOR_PRIMARY} = "VOLTZITE (China-backed)"
{MISSION_ELEMENT} = "reliable energy"
{INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE} = "electrical grid operations"
{EXPERT_SPECIALIST} = "Energy Security Director"
{REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK} = "NERC CIP compliance"
```

#### **Manufacturing Sector Personalization**
```
Industry Detection:
IF: Company domain contains "foods|manufacturing|production|processing"
OR: Industry classification = "Food Manufacturing"
THEN: Deploy Manufacturing Sector Intelligence Sequence

Variable Replacement:
{SECTOR_THREAT_STAT_1} = "89% increase in manufacturing sector targeting (Mandiant M-Trends 2024)"
{SECTOR_FINANCIAL_IMPACT} = "$18.3M average incident cost for manufacturers (IBM 2024)"  
{THREAT_ACTOR_PRIMARY} = "CHRYSENE (China-backed)"
{MISSION_ELEMENT} = "access to healthy food"
{INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE} = "food production operations"
{EXPERT_SPECIALIST} = "Food Manufacturing Security Director"

```

### **Geographic Threat Correlation**

#### **Regional Threat Actor Mapping**
```
Geographic Intelligence Variables:
{REGIONAL_THREAT_ACTIVITY} = Based on prospect location + current campaigns
{STATE_INCIDENT_EXAMPLES} = Recent incidents in prospect's state
{LOCAL_REGULATORY_PRESSURE} = State-specific compliance requirements

Example Mappings:
Texas Energy â†’ "VOLTZITE targeting Texas grid operations since Q3 2024"

```

#### **Technology Stack Correlation**
```
Technology Detection (from public sources):
Vendor Mentions â†’ CVE Correlation â†’ Vulnerability Messaging

Example Logic:
IF: "Schneider Electric" mentioned in job postings/news
THEN: {TECH_VULNERABILITY} = "Schneider SCADA systems vulnerable to CVE-2024-7217"

IF: "Wonderware" or "AVEVA" detected
THEN: {TECH_VULNERABILITY} = "Industrial HMI systems at risk from CVE-2024-4577"

IF: "GE Digital" or "Predix" mentioned  
THEN: {TECH_VULNERABILITY} = "Industrial IoT platforms susceptible to CVE-2024-3400"
```

### **Executive Targeting Personalization**
