## 1. Introduction
### 1.1. Document purpose
"This document has been prepared for [Organization].

This document describes the attack path observed during a recent cyber security incident. It presents the steps taken by the threat actor, including associated Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (TTP) details. Where possible the TTPs are expressed in MITRE ATT&CK terminology to aid in correlation and cross-referencing with other threat intelligence sources.

This document is aimed at helping readers learn from the incident and prepare to defend against possible future attacks. Its attack path structure is designed to show how the latest cyber attacks actually happen in the real world. The inclusion of TTP details allows readers to map the attack steps to their own organization, validating their security posture, and feeding into their risk management process."
