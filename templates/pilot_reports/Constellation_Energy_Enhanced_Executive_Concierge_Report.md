## Closing: Your Moment of Truth

Joe, you came to Constellation to transform American energy. You've already made incredible progress with the Three Mile Island restart, the Calpine acquisition, and your clean energy leadership. But none of that transformation matters if we can't secure it against the threats we know are targeting us.

The federal government depends on reliable energy. Millions of customers count on uninterrupted power. Your vision for America's clean energy future requires us to act now. The nation-state targeting of nuclear facilities proves we're already under attack. The energy sector ransomware surge shows we're in the crosshairs. The Microsoft partnership creates unprecedented responsibility.

But this isn't about compliance or fear—it's about leadership. It's about being the CEO who didn't just talk about clean energy transformation but secured it. Who didn't just restart Three Mile Island but made it the most secure nuclear facility in America. Who didn't just acquire Calpine but integrated it with world-class cybersecurity.

The investment is significant but the return is transformational. The risks are real but manageable through expert partnership. The opportunity for industry leadership is yours to seize.

Your legacy as America's clean energy security leader awaits your decision.

**The clean energy transition depends on you. The nation's energy security is watching. History will judge whether you secured America's energy future.**

**The time for decision is now.**
