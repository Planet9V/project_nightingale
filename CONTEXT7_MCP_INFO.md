# Context7 MCP Information

## Installation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Context7 MCP has been successfully installed and configured in your Project Nightingale setup.

## What is Context7?

Context7 is a documentation MCP server that provides intelligent documentation search and retrieval capabilities. It appears to be designed to help with:
- Documentation queries
- Context-aware information retrieval
- Knowledge base interactions

## Configuration

Added to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
"context7": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
        "-y",
        "--package=@upstash/context7-mcp",
        "@upstash/context7-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {}
}
```

## Current Status
- **Package**: @upstash/context7-mcp v1.0.13
- **Status**: Installed and configured
- **Environment**: No additional environment variables required
- **Other MCPs**: All remain intact and functional
  - ✅ task-master-ai (with API keys)
  - ✅ graphlit
  - ✅ pinecone
  - ✅ neo4j
  - ✅ context7 (NEW)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude** to load the context7 MCP tools
2. After restart, you should see tools with prefix `mcp__context7__`
3. Use these tools for documentation queries and context retrieval

## Notes

- Context7 doesn't require API keys or credentials
- It runs as a documentation server on stdio
- Backed up previous configuration to `.cursor/mcp.json.backup.[timestamp]`

The installation was successful and all other MCP servers remain unchanged and functional.
