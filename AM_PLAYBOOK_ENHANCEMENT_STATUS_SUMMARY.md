## üí° CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS

**Primary Finding**: The v4.1 enhancement work has already been completed! All 10 Account Managers have enhanced playbooks that follow the official template.

**Recommended Focus Areas**:
1. **Cleanup**: Remove confusion by archiving older versions
2. **Validation**: Ensure v4.1 playbooks have complete, actual data
3. **Enhancement**: Add any missing contact information via web search
4. **Organization**: Establish clear version control structure

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 days for validation and cleanup (vs. 12 days for full enhancement)

---

## üö® ACTION ITEMS

1. **Immediate**: Archive older playbook versions to prevent confusion
2. **Short-term**: Validate data quality in all v4.1 playbooks
3. **Ongoing**: Maintain single source of truth for AM playbooks

**Note**: The initial assessment comparing the older version to the template was accurate - those older versions (without V4_1 in filename) do need enhancement. However, the enhancement work has already been done and v4.1 versions exist for all AMs.
