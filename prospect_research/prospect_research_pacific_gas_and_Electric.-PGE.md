Major capital investments are planned through 2028, with annual funding requests often subject to CPUC approval.21 Proposals should align with these cycles, ideally engaging early in the planning phase to influence budget allocation.
Strategic Initiatives Timeline: Align engagement with ongoing strategic initiatives, such as wildfire mitigation plans (e.g., 87% of undergrounding work planned for 2023-2026 in high-risk areas) and digital transformation efforts (e.g., Propel program).23
Regulatory Filings: Monitor CPUC filings and decisions, as these often signal new priorities, funding opportunities, or compliance requirements that NCC Group solutions can address. For example, new funding for energization work or changes in rate cases.82
Post-Incident/Seasonal Focus: Be prepared to engage promptly if security incidents occur or during periods of heightened risk (e.g., wildfire season), as PG&E's focus on safety and resilience intensifies during these times.
