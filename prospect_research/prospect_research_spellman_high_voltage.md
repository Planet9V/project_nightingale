**1\. Organization Overview**

* **Full legal name and corporate structure:** The full legal name of the organization is Spellman High-Voltage Electronics Corporation. It operates as a privately held, family-owned and managed company. This ownership structure, maintained for over seven decades, often fosters a strategic orientation towards long-term stability and sustainable growth, contrasting with the quarterly pressures faced by publicly traded entities. Such a structure can also lead to a more centralized, albeit potentially more agile, decision-making framework, particularly with family members like Dr. Loren Skeist (CEO) and Marc Skeist (VP of Strategic Initiatives) in pivotal leadership roles. While one archived source from 2018 listed the company as "Public," this appears to be an anomaly or a reference to public registration data rather than stock market listing. The overwhelming consensus from company statements and more recent records confirms its private, family-owned status. The stability afforded by family ownership can be advantageous for forming long-term strategic partnerships, as there's less likelihood of sudden shifts in strategy due to external shareholder pressures. However, it may also imply a more cautious approach to large capital investments unless a compelling long-term return on investment or significant risk mitigation is clearly demonstrated.  
* **Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations:** Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corporation was founded in 1947\. Some records indicate a later incorporation or federal registration date (e.g., "Founded Jan 1, 1954" and "federally registered Feb 28, 2002" ), which likely pertain to legal entity formalizations rather than the operational commencement of the business.The company's World Headquarters is located at 475 Wireless Blvd, Hauppauge, New York 11788, USA. Islip, New York, is also mentioned in some sources , a neighboring town within the same operational hub; Hauppauge is the more consistently cited specific address for the headquarters.Spellman boasts a significant global operational and manufacturing footprint, including:  
  * **USA:** Hauppauge, NY (HQ, Manufacturing, Design, Service) ; Valhalla, NY (Manufacturing, Sales for the Lorad brand, Service, R\&D).  
  * **Mexico:** Matamoros (Manufacturing, Design, Service). This facility is a cornerstone of Spellman's vertical integration strategy.  
  * **United Kingdom:** Pulborough (European HQ, Manufacturing, Design, Service).  
  * **Germany:** Bochum (Manufacturing, Design, Sales for K\&S Brand medical X-ray generators).  
  * **China:** Suzhou (Manufacturing, Design, Service, China HQ) ; Beijing (Sales Office).  
  * **Japan:** Tokyo (Sales, Design, Service); Osaka (Sales Office).  
  * **Korea:** Incheon (Sales Office).  
  * **India:** A new manufacturing center is under development in Visakhapatnam , complementing an existing service facility in Pune and a sales office in Kolkata.

This extensive network of international facilities underscores a complex operational structure and supply chain. Such distribution inherently expands the company's potential attack surface and necessitates robust, standardized security measures across diverse geopolitical and regulatory environments. Each manufacturing site, in particular, will possess significant Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure that requires specialized security attention.

* **Organizational history and key milestones:** Spellman's history is marked by consistent growth, both organically through facility expansions and product development, and strategically through acquisitions aimed at enhancing technological capabilities and market reach.  
  * **1947:** Founded as a family-owned business with an early focus on custom high-voltage power supplies.

The pattern of acquisitions (Start-Spellman, Del High Voltage, Lorad LPX) suggests that Spellman has integrated multiple entities over time. This process can often lead to a heterogeneous IT and OT landscape, as legacy systems from acquired companies may persist. While some consolidation efforts have been made (e.g., the 2009 Valhalla production transfer ), the continued operation and support of distinct product lines from these acquisitions (like those from Del Power, Bertan, and LORAD LPX at the Valhalla site ) imply the presence of varied manufacturing technologies and control systems. Such diversity can create complexities for unified cybersecurity management, potentially increasing the risk of vulnerabilities if integration is not meticulously managed. This historical context points towards a potential need for comprehensive assessments to identify and mitigate security debt accumulated through these strategic expansions.

* **Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):** Spellman's primary business is being the world's leading independent supplier of precision DC high voltage power supplies, X-Ray generators, and Monoblock® X-Ray sources. These products serve a wide range of applications in markets including Medical Imaging, Industrial Equipment, Scientific Research, Security Screening, X-Ray Technology, Telecommunications, Power Conversion, Electronics Manufacturing, Medical Devices, Semiconductor Fabrication, Inspection, Environmental monitoring, and Undersea Power systems.Relevant industry codes include:

* **Precise company size metrics:**  
  * **Annual revenue:** Publicly available, precise multi-year revenue trends are limited due to Spellman's private status. However, various sources provide estimates:  
    * Growjo estimates annual revenue at $318.6M (recent, undated).  
    * LeadIQ suggests a range of $100M \- $1B (recent, undated).  
    * NAICS.com reported $285.2M based on 2018 data.  
    * The UK subsidiary, Spellman High Voltage Electronics Limited, reported revenue of £38.8M (approximately $48.5M USD as of mid-2024) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022\.  
    * *Analysis:* Considering these points, Spellman's global annual revenue likely falls within the $300M to $500M range. The UK subsidiary's figures offer a concrete data point for a segment of their global operations.  
  * **Employee count:**  
    * The company states it has over 2,100 employees globally. This figure is corroborated by multiple external sources suggesting a range of 1,001-5,000 employees.  
    * An older estimate (2018) from NAICS.com listed 1,000 total employees, with 500 at the Hauppauge HQ.  
    * Specific site employee counts (may be dated): Matamoros, Mexico: \~900 employees ; Suzhou, China: 170 employees in 2022, with plans to grow to 300-400 in 3-5 years ; Pulborough, UK: 105-172 employees.  
    * *Analysis:* The most reliable current estimate is over 2,100 employees globally. A detailed breakdown by department is not available, though high-level organizational structure percentages are mentioned in one source.  
  * **Market capitalization if publicly traded:** Not applicable, as Spellman is a privately held company.  
  * **Growth rate and financial trajectory:**  
    * Growjo reported an 8% employee count growth in the past year , indicating expansion.  
    * The UK subsidiary demonstrated healthy profitability with a Net Profit of £6.94M for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 , on revenues of £38.8M for FYE March 31, 2022\.

    * **2011:** Acquired the Lorad LPX product line from Hologic, Inc. (USA).  
    * Acquisition of K\&S Röntgenwerk Bochum (Germany), now Spellman GmbH. This M\&A activity underscores the potential for a diverse and complex technology landscape within Spellman, as integrating disparate systems from acquired companies can be a long-term process.  
* **Ownership structure:** Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corporation is a privately held, family-owned and managed company. Dr. Loren Skeist holds the roles of President, CEO, and Owner. One source also lists "D.S." and "K.S." as "Owner" , likely indicating other Skeist family members involved in the ownership. There is no indication of private equity involvement, and the Skeist family ownership appears to be continuous and stable. This long-standing private ownership (over 75 years ) suggests a corporate culture that may be characterized by stability, a degree of fiscal conservatism, and potentially a more insular decision-making process. Strategic decisions are likely made with a strong emphasis on long-term value and the preservation of the company's legacy, as articulated by the CEO. This could mean that while the company may be less swayed by short-term market trends in technology adoption, it may also be slower to embrace significant operational changes unless a robust business case, closely aligned with its core values of customer focus, quality, and sustainable growth, is presented.

  * **CIO and CISO:** Mitchell Alexander holds the combined role of Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer. His extensive tenure (since 2000\) and broad responsibilities cover IT strategy, enterprise cybersecurity, network operations, and digital and software design.  
  * **Direct Reports to CIO/CISO:** TheOrg.com's profile for Mitchell Alexander indicates "No direct reports". This is unusual for a CIO/CISO in a global organization of Spellman's scale (over 2,100 employees, multiple international manufacturing sites ). This data point, if accurate, could suggest several structural possibilities:  
    1. A very lean central IT and cybersecurity leadership team, with significant reliance on outsourced services or regionally managed IT personnel.  
    2. A distributed IT/security governance model, where key IT and security personnel are embedded within other business functions or regional operations, rather than direct-reporting to the central CIO/CISO. Evidence for this includes a Senior Information Technology Manager (Noe F.) reporting to Marc Skeist (VP Strategic Initiatives) , and a Director of Network Operations (John T.) reporting to Kunwar Raj Harricharran (VP Global Operations).  
    3. The "no direct reports" information on TheOrg.com might be an inaccuracy or reflect a very flat organizational structure directly under the CIO/CISO. Understanding the true operational structure of Spellman's IT and security functions is critical. If central leadership is indeed very lean, influencing regional or operational managers who hold de facto IT/security responsibilities becomes paramount. If the model is distributed, identifying these key embedded personnel across different departments will be essential for an effective engagement strategy. This situation points to a significant need for further discovery regarding how IT and security governance, operational management, and incident response are practically handled on a day-to-day basis across Spellman's global enterprise.  
  * **Security operations leadership:** No individual with a specific title such as "Head of Security Operations" or "Security Operations Manager" was identified in the provided materials. This function is presumed to fall under the overall responsibility of Mitchell Alexander as CISO.  
  * **Compliance and risk management leadership:** Similarly, no specific individual with a dedicated title in compliance or risk management leadership was found. These functions are likely shared between the CISO (for IT/cyber risk and technical compliance) and the CFO (for financial and broader enterprise risk). The existence of a Chief of Staff to the Global VP of Quality, involved in high-level project and initiative management , suggests that the Quality department also plays a role in operational risk management and adherence to standards.  
  * **Digital transformation leadership:** No executive is explicitly titled as leading digital transformation. Initiatives in this area would likely be driven by Mitchell Alexander (CIO/CISO) in conjunction with Marc Skeist (VP Strategic Initiatives) and potentially other operational leaders.  
* **Middle management in relevant departments:**  
  * **IT Infrastructure Managers/Directors:**  
    * Noe F. is listed as a Senior Information Technology Manager, reporting to Marc Skeist, VP of Strategic Initiatives.  
    * John T. is listed as Director Of Network Operations, reporting to Kunwar Raj Harricharran, VP Global Operations. The fact that these IT leadership roles report outside of a direct line to the CIO/CISO (Mitchell Alexander) is noteworthy and further suggests a potentially decentralized or matrixed IT operational model. Clarifying their specific responsibilities (e.g., corporate IT versus manufacturing/OT systems) and their influence on technology decisions will be important.  
  * **Security operations managers:** Not explicitly identified in the provided materials.  
  * **Network and systems administrators:** Specific managerial roles not identified.  
  * **Procurement and vendor management contacts:**  
    * Lonnie Rosenfeld, as Vice President Of Global Supply Chain, has oversight of procurement functions.  
    * A job posting exists for a Director, North America Sourcing & Purchasing (specific name not available). This role is tasked with creating and implementing sourcing and purchasing strategies, managing supplier relationships, and negotiating long-term agreements.  
    * Spellman has publicly available Purchasing Terms and Conditions , indicating a formalized procurement process, which includes Net 60 payment terms.  
    * *Analysis:* Significant technology and cybersecurity investments would likely involve a multi-layered approval process: technical validation and requirements definition by the CIO/CISO and relevant IT/engineering teams; business case development linking the investment to risk reduction, operational efficiency, or customer needs; adherence to formal procurement processes managed by the Sourcing & Purchasing department and the VP Global Supply Chain; financial review and budget allocation by the CFO; and final approval from the CEO, potentially with input from other key family owners or senior leaders.  
  * *Information Gap:* Specific names, direct contact information, and detailed responsibilities for many middle management positions, particularly within security operations and regional IT support, are not available from the provided snippets. Further research, potentially through professional networking platforms, would be needed to identify these individuals.  
* **Decision-making patterns:** Spellman's approach to decision-making appears to have evolved. CEO Dr. Loren Skeist describes his leadership style as "cautious, team-based, and process-oriented," a shift from his father's more entrepreneurial methods. His focus has been on strengthening processes and developing organizational capabilities to support global growth.The company reportedly undertook an initiative to implement a "GDS horizontal, high-performance team (GDS HPT) model." This was aimed at fostering more systematic, inclusive, and transparent governance, improving collaboration across its global sites, and better integrating new leadership talent. This initiative was partly a response to internal challenges such as friction among senior leaders and a lack of clarity in decision-making processes. This move towards a more structured and collaborative decision-making framework suggests that proposals for significant investments, such as cybersecurity solutions, will likely be evaluated by multiple stakeholders.The formal Purchasing Terms and Conditions and the responsibilities outlined in the job description for the Director, North America Sourcing & Purchasing (which include stakeholder engagement, forecast analysis, supply plan development, and senior management recommendations) further support the likelihood of a methodical and multi-faceted approval process for technology acquisitions.The company’s quality statement, "To Understand and Provide What Our Customers Value" , is a core tenet. This customer-centric philosophy, combined with the CEO's emphasis on a "team-based, process-oriented" approach and the adoption of the GDS HPT model, suggests that a sales strategy emphasizing partnership and collaborative solution development will be most effective. NCC Group should position its offerings not merely as products or services, but as integral solutions that help Spellman address its unique operational challenges, protect its valuable intellectual property (especially for its custom-designed products ), ensure the resilience of its global operations, and support its strategic growth objectives. Given the likely involvement of cross-functional teams in the decision-making process, a multi-threaded engagement strategy targeting various stakeholders will be essential. *Information Gap:* Specific budgetary authority levels and precise financial approval thresholds for technology purchases are not publicly available. The exact step-by-step approval workflow for technology is inferred from the available information rather than explicitly detailed.

## **GTM Analysis Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture**

**Executive Summary**  
Spellman High Voltage Electronics' technical environment is characterized by a blend of enterprise systems supporting a global manufacturing and distribution network, alongside specialized Operational Technology (OT) integral to its high-voltage power supply and X-Ray product manufacturing. Publicly available information on their specific enterprise systems (ERP, CRM) and detailed network architecture is limited, which is typical for a privately held manufacturing company focused on protecting proprietary processes. However, their use of modern design tools (CAD, simulation software ) and global collaboration implies a need for robust network infrastructure and data management capabilities. The company's manufacturing sites in the US, Mexico, UK, Germany, China, and soon India , each house critical OT environments, likely with varying degrees of modernization and OT/IT convergence.  
Key security posture findings indicate that while Spellman has a designated CIO/CISO (Mitchell Alexander ), the depth of the dedicated security team and the specifics of their security program elements (frameworks, comprehensive public policies) are not extensively detailed in public sources. The company's history of acquisitions may have resulted in a heterogeneous technology landscape, potentially introducing security complexities and legacy system vulnerabilities. There is no public record of major security breaches, but like any manufacturing firm with significant IP and global operations, they face threats from industrial espionage, ransomware, and supply chain attacks.  
Critical technical challenges likely revolve around securing a distributed global infrastructure, managing the security of diverse OT environments (including legacy systems), ensuring data integrity and IP protection for custom designs, and standardizing IT/security practices across numerous international sites and acquired entities. The integration of IT and OT systems, especially in older plants or those brought in via acquisition, presents an ongoing challenge common to the manufacturing sector.  
The current vendor landscape for specific security solutions is not widely publicized. However, their job postings indicate usage of tools like LinkedIn Recruiter and ATS systems , and their design processes involve CAD and simulation software. They utilize common enterprise technologies like Windows Server,.NET, and PHP for some applications.  
Primary security threats and risks include the compromise of sensitive intellectual property related to their custom high-voltage designs, disruption of manufacturing operations through attacks on OT systems (potentially by actors like VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, or ELECTRUM, which target industrial sectors), ransomware attacks impacting business continuity, and vulnerabilities within their global supply chain. The expansion into new regions like India also introduces new regional threat actors and regulatory compliance requirements that must be managed.

We understand the unique challenges of legacy systems, OT/IT convergence, and the need for security solutions that do not disrupt operations."  
  * Highlight the ability to provide visibility into "black box" OT networks, detect industrial-specific threats that generic IT security tools miss, and offer actionable guidance for risk reduction.  
* **Unique differentiation against current vendors:**  
  * *Analysis:* Since specific incumbent security vendors are not known, differentiation will be based on the specialized nature of NCC-Dragos offerings.  
  * "Unlike general IT security providers, NCC Group and Dragos offer deep, specialized expertise in Operational Technology cybersecurity, with industry-leading threat intelligence (Dragos) and proven assessment/response capabilities (NCC Group) tailored to industrial environments like Spellman's. We don't just adapt IT security tools for OT; we provide purpose-built OT security solutions and services."  
  * Focus on the combination of Dragos's technology and threat intelligence with NCC Group's global consulting, assessment, and managed services capabilities as a comprehensive offering.  
* **Implementation approach based on technical realities:**  
  * **Phased Rollout:** Given Spellman's global footprint, a phased approach is recommended. Start with an assessment of the most critical or representative manufacturing sites (e.g., Hauppauge HQ, a large overseas plant like Matamoros or Suzhou, and the new India facility).  
  * **Pilot Program:** Consider a pilot deployment of the Dragos Platform at one key facility to demonstrate value and refine the deployment process before broader rollout.  
  * **Collaboration with Existing Teams:** Work closely with Mitchell Alexander (CIO/CISO) and any existing IT/OT personnel, respecting their operational knowledge and constraints. The approach should be collaborative, not disruptive.  
  * **Focus on Quick Wins:** Identify and address high-impact, low-complexity vulnerabilities early to build confidence and demonstrate immediate value (e.g., improving network segmentation, basic OT hardening).  
  * **Knowledge Transfer:** Ensure knowledge transfer to Spellman staff to build their internal OT security capabilities over time.

The combination of Spellman's reliance on proprietary technology, its global manufacturing footprint with complex OT environments, and its history of acquisitions creates a compelling case for specialized OT cybersecurity services. The expansion into India provides a timely opportunity to engage them on securing new infrastructure from the ground up.

## **GTM Analysis Part 3: Strategic Sales Approach & Battle Card**

**Executive Summary**  
The strategic sales approach for Spellman High Voltage Electronics should be centered on a partnership model, emphasizing NCC Group-Dragos's specialized expertise in securing complex global manufacturing and Operational Technology (OT) environments. Given Spellman's family-owned nature, long-term focus, and commitment to custom solutions for critical industries , the value proposition must highlight sustained risk reduction, protection of vital intellectual property, and ensuring operational resilience, rather than short-term gains.  
The **priority level for engagement is high**, driven by several factors: Spellman's significant global OT footprint , the critical nature of the industries they serve (medical, security, semiconductor) , their ongoing global expansion (new India facility) , and the potential for a heterogeneous technology environment due to past acquisitions. An **expected engagement timeline** for initial assessment and pilot deployment could span 3-6 months, with a longer-term strategy for comprehensive global rollout.  
**Key stakeholders to target** include Mitchell Alexander (CIO/CISO) as the primary technical decision-maker ; Robert Kerley (CFO) for budget approval ; Dr. Loren Skeist (CEO) for strategic alignment and final approval ; and
