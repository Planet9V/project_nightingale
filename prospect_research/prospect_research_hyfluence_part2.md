Founding, Mission, and Vision:
Hyfluence Systems Corp. was founded in 2022.3 The company's stated mission underscores its ambition: "Hyfluence aspires to nothing less than enabling our societal transformation to low-carbon mobility through the provision of a new generation of resilient, efficient and innovative hydrogen infrastructure".8 This mission is guided by three core principles: Humility, Rigour, and Integrity.8 The company is "driven to build and nurture a company... that supports the livelihoods and well-being of our teammates and community" and is "determined to do our part in leading the global energy transition... by producing superb hydrogen infrastructure".8
This strong articulation of enabling "resilient," "efficient," and "innovative" infrastructure, particularly when viewed alongside their principle of "Rigour" — defined as being "thorough, diligent, and methodical in designing, building and supporting safe and reliable systems" — points towards a corporate culture that should be inherently receptive to solutions enhancing system integrity and safety.8 Advanced Operational Technology (OT) security solutions directly contribute to these stated values by protecting against disruptions and ensuring the dependable operation of their critical hydrogen fueling systems. For NCC Group, this alignment presents an opportunity to frame OT security not merely as a cost center, but as an essential enabler of Hyfluence's core mission and product promises.
Industry Classification (NAICS/SIC), Primary Business Activities, and Market Segments:
Hyfluence's primary industry is identified as Electrical Equipment.3 The company is also categorized under Other Utilities, CleanTech, and Climate Tech, reflecting its focus on the clean energy sector.3 Its core business activities encompass the design, manufacture, supply, and service of hydrogen fueling equipment. This equipment caters to a wide range of transportation modes, including cars, trucks, buses, rail, and marine applications.9 Key products include comprehensive hydrogen refueling stations, hydrogen dispensers capable of operating at both 350 and 700 bar, and hydrogen tube trailer filling systems.11
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325120 for Industrial Gas Manufacturing includes hydrogen manufacturing.13 Similarly, the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2813 for Industrial Gases also encompasses hydrogen.14 These classifications situate Hyfluence within the broader industrial and chemical manufacturing sectors, specifically focusing on a critical component of the emerging hydrogen economy.
The company's engagement across diverse market segments, from "heavy-duty" to "light-duty" refueling solutions 11 for various transport applications, signifies a comprehensive market strategy. This breadth, however, implies that Hyfluence's systems must adhere to a range of operational standards and will likely encounter varied OT security challenges depending on the specific deployment environment. For instance, a public refueling station for transit buses 16 may have different uptime requirements and threat profiles compared to a system designed for a private fleet depot or a marine application. This operational diversity necessitates highly adaptable and robust control systems, which, in turn, demand comprehensive and equally adaptable OT security measures. NCC Group can leverage this by tailoring discussions around the unique security needs of these varied end-use cases.
Geographic Footprint: Headquarters, Manufacturing, and Key Operational Locations:
Hyfluence's headquarters and primary manufacturing facility are located in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.1 The company is an active participant in the Metro Vancouver hydrogen technology cluster, a significant hub for hydrogen innovation in Canada.19 While its roots and manufacturing are Canadian, Hyfluence is actively expanding its operational footprint across North America. Notably, it is delivering refueling systems to customers in the United States, including a project for Lewis County Transit in Washington State 16 and the Avina Clean Hydrogen project in California.18
This expansion into the U.S. market, particularly into a state like California with its advanced regulatory environment for clean energy and emissions 18, signifies an important strategic direction. It also means Hyfluence will increasingly be subject to stringent U.S. federal and state regulations. These regulations often include mandates or strong recommendations related to critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity, such as guidelines from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and specific state-level rules like California's SB-1291 concerning hydrogen fueling stations.24 Navigating this complex regulatory landscape presents both a challenge and an opportunity for Hyfluence, and by extension, for security partners like NCC Group who can offer expertise in compliance, gap analysis, and the implementation of recognized security frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
1.2. Financial Health and Corporate Structure
Ownership Structure (Private Company) and Investors:
Hyfluence Systems Corp. is a privately held company.3 Publicly available information identifies Active Impact Investments as its sole investor. Active Impact Investments is a Canadian Venture Capital firm that participated in Hyfluence's Seed/Pre-Seed funding round, securing $1.7 million.3 This firm holds a minority stake in Hyfluence, and there is no explicit mention of board representation in the available data.3 Some data sources like Tracxn list Hyfluence as "unfunded," which contrasts with information from Pitchbook and CB Insights; the latter are generally considered more reliable for venture capital funding data.6 This discrepancy might indicate that Hyfluence has maintained a relatively low financial profile or that some databases are not fully updated.
The $1.7 million seed funding is a modest sum for a company involved in the capital-intensive development and manufacturing of hardware for hydrogen infrastructure.3 This could suggest lean operations and potential cost sensitivity. However, the investor, Active Impact Investments, specializes in "climate tech" and supports "early-stage climate tech companies with early revenue and significant growth potential".26 Their investment, therefore, signals confidence in Hyfluence's technology and market prospects despite the initial funding amount. For NCC Group, this context suggests that emphasizing the return on investment (ROI) of security measures—particularly in terms of preventing costly operational disruptions, protecting intellectual property, and building stakeholder trust—will be crucial. Such an approach aligns with attracting further investment and ensuring long-term viability.
Furthermore, Active Impact Investments' mission to "support environmental sustainability through profitable investment" 26 implies a focus on portfolio companies with strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) credentials and long-term resilience. A significant cybersecurity incident could severely damage Hyfluence's reputation, financial stability, and ability to attract future funding, thereby impacting the investor's ESG goals and ROI. NCC Group can effectively position OT security services as a critical component of operational resilience, risk management, and good corporate governance, appealing not only to Hyfluence's leadership but also to the priorities of their sustainability-focused investors.
Funding Rounds, Revenue (if available), and Growth Trajectory:
Hyfluence secured $1.7 million in a Seed/Pre-Seed funding round, with deal dates cited as December 1, 2022 (Pitchbook) or May 1, 2023 (CB Insights), from Active Impact Investments.3 Pitchbook indicates that the company is in the "Generating Revenue" stage 3, while CB Insights reports revenue as "0 FY undefined".25 As an early-stage private entity, precise revenue figures are typically not disclosed publicly. The "Generating Revenue" status, combined with recent project announcements such as those with Lewis County Transit and Avina Clean Hydrogen 16, suggests that Hyfluence is transitioning into a critical growth phase. This phase is characterized by the scaling of operations and an increase in system deployments, which can introduce new operational complexities and potential vulnerabilities if not managed with foresight.
The transition from research and development and initial prototyping to commercial deployments and revenue generation represents a pivotal juncture for any technology startup.3 During this period, systems undergo real-world field testing, and operational demands intensify. Security vulnerabilities that might have been overlooked during rapid development cycles can emerge as significant liabilities. This presents an opportune moment for NCC Group to propose foundational OT security assessments and advocate for secure architecture design principles to be embedded in new deployments.
The broader Canadian hydrogen sector is experiencing robust growth, with reported revenues from survey respondents increasing by 69.6% between 2021 and 2023, and Western Canada generating $166.1 million in 2023.30 Significant investments are also flowing into British Columbia's hydrogen ecosystem.20 This favorable market environment provides a strong tailwind for Hyfluence. However, such growth also intensifies competition and elevates the sector's profile as a target for sophisticated cyber threat actors aiming to disrupt critical infrastructure or exfiltrate valuable intellectual property. As a newer entrant, Hyfluence must ensure its systems are not only operationally robust but also cyber-resilient to maintain a competitive edge and safeguard its innovations.
Employee Count and Organizational Structure:
Information on employee count varies slightly, with Pitchbook reporting 14 total employees 3 and Climatebase listing 6-10 employees.31 Hyfluence describes itself as a "close-knit team" and a "rapidly growing startup".32 Current open positions listed include roles such as Mechanical Technician and Procurement and Supply Chain Specialist.32
A small team is characteristic of an early-stage hardware-focused startup and has direct implications for resource allocation, including dedicated cybersecurity personnel. With a team of 14 or fewer individuals tasked with developing, manufacturing, and deploying complex hydrogen refueling systems 3, internal resources are likely to be stretched. Specialized functions like OT cybersecurity often require dedicated expertise that may not be present in-house. The nature of the current job openings does not suggest an immediate internal buildup of specialized security roles.32 This situation creates a clear opportunity for NCC Group to offer its specialized OT cybersecurity consulting and managed services to fill this expertise gap.
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships, Business Units/Divisions (if any):
According to its LEI registration details, Hyfluence Systems Corp. has no parent company data available, nor any direct or ultimate child data.1 The company appears to operate as a standalone entity. No distinct business units or divisions are mentioned in the available information, with its activities organized around its product lines: hydrogen refueling stations, the FleetPilot™ Tactical Fueler, and the HyLoader™ Tube-Trailer Loader.12
Operating as a standalone entity means Hyfluence does not benefit from the cybersecurity umbrella that a larger parent corporation might provide, such as established security frameworks, shared resources, or centralized security operations centers. Consequently, Hyfluence bears sole responsibility for establishing and maintaining its security posture. This independence makes them a direct and potentially comprehensive client for end-to-end security solutions, from strategic advisory to technical implementation and ongoing monitoring.
1.3. Leadership Team
Key Executives (CEO: Ron Klopfer, CTO: Angela Das) and Board Members:

Leadership Background, Expertise, and Public Statements on Strategy:
Public statements from Hyfluence's leadership offer valuable perspectives on their strategic direction and perceived industry challenges. Ron Klopfer has expressed enthusiasm for partnering with the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA) "to drive the build-out of hydrogen infrastructure domestically and abroad".7 He also stated, "We're at a place where hydrogen technology works, it works really well – we're now truly at the starting line where we can build a legitimate commercial hydrogen industry".28 This highlights a focus on growth and commercialization, capitalizing on the maturity of hydrogen technology.
Angela Das has emphasized the technical aspects of their products and the challenges in the field. Regarding the FleetPilot™ line, she noted it is "specifically designed for growing fleet deployments where mobile refuelers are unable to comply with the new SAE J2601-5 standard for safe high-speed fueling".10 More critically, she has pointed out that "Station reliability starts with getting the design right... many hydrogen stations today fail because their compression storage and dispensing subsystems are improperly sized".38
Klopfer's optimism about the hydrogen industry's readiness for commercial scale-up reinforces Hyfluence's growth-oriented strategy. Das's comments on station reliability and the importance of correct system design point directly to a core technical challenge they are addressing. If refueling stations can fail due to improper sizing and design of their subsystems, they are equally, if not more, susceptible to failures induced by cyberattacks targeting their control systems. This provides a strong rationale for NCC Group to position its OT security services as a means to ensure that Hyfluence's commitment to "superb hydrogen infrastructure" 8 is not undermined by preventable cyber incidents, thereby safeguarding their operational integrity and market reputation.
1.4. Recent Developments & Corporate Milestones
Key Announcements, Partnerships:
Hyfluence has recently announced several key partnerships and contract awards that signify its growing market presence and strategic collaborations. The company was awarded the contract to supply hydrogen refueling infrastructure to Lewis County Transit in Washington, USA. This project involves the deployment of Hyfluence's FleetPilot™ mobile fueler and is being executed in partnership with Chart Industries and its subsidiary Howden, who will provide key compression components.6
Similarly, Hyfluence secured a contract to supply hydrogen infrastructure, including heavy-duty fueling stations and its HyLoader™ tube-trailer loader, to Avina Clean Hydrogen for a project in California, USA. This engagement also involves partnership with Chart Industries and Howden for compression components.6 In March 2023, Hyfluence also became a member of the Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA), indicating its commitment to industry collaboration and development.3
The partnerships with established industrial equipment suppliers like Chart Industries and Howden for "key compression components" 6 are particularly noteworthy. These larger entities often have their own stringent cybersecurity and supply chain security standards. Hyfluence's integration with such partners may necessitate adherence to these standards, creating a potential driver for adopting more robust security measures. If NCC Group has existing relationships with Chart Industries or Howden, these could serve as valuable leverage points or provide insights into the security expectations Hyfluence might face.
Furthermore, the projects with Lewis County Transit and Avina Clean Hydrogen involve the deployment of Hyfluence's systems into critical public and commercial infrastructure within the United States.16 This context elevates the importance of system security and resilience, not only for Hyfluence's direct customers but also concerning broader public safety and energy security considerations. Failures or cyberattacks on these systems could lead to significant operational disruptions and public impact, underscoring an implicit, if not explicit, need for robust OT security measures from the outset.
Awards and Recognitions:
Hyfluence has received industry recognition for its early-stage achievements. The company earned an Honourable Mention for the Hydrogen Mobility Award at the Canadian Hydrogen Convention in 2024.62 Additionally, Hyfluence was a finalist in two categories—Entrepreneurial Spirit and Environmental Sustainability—at the Burnaby Business Excellence Awards in 2024.63
These accolades, particularly for "Environmental Sustainability" and contributions to "Hydrogen Mobility," enhance Hyfluence's brand image and credibility within the clean energy sector.62 For a startup, such positive recognition is invaluable for attracting customers, talent, and further investment. However, this growing reputation also makes the company a more visible target. A security incident leading to operational disruption, safety concerns, or data compromise could significantly tarnish this positive image. NCC Group can articulate how proactive cybersecurity measures serve to protect Hyfluence's hard-won brand equity and maintain stakeholder confidence.
Expansion Plans and R&D Focus:
Hyfluence has stated plans to scale up its manufacturing operations in British Columbia starting in 2024.7 The company operates an R&D facility in Burnaby, BC, with a current focus on the engineering of "next-gen high-reliability hydrogen fueling architectures".7
This dual focus on scaling manufacturing and advancing R&D into "next-gen" systems 7 presents a critical window of opportunity for integrating security. As Hyfluence develops new fueling architectures, incorporating secure-by-design principles from the initial stages is far more effective and cost-efficient than attempting to retrofit security measures later. NCC Group can offer specialized services to embed security into Hyfluence's R&D processes and product development lifecycle, ensuring that their next generation of high-reliability systems are also cyber-resilient.

Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture (Hyfluence Systems)
2.1. Products and Technology Overview
Detailed Description of Hydrogen Refueling Stations, FleetPilot™ Tactical Fueler, HyLoader™ Tube-Trailer Loader:
Hyfluence Systems Corp. offers a portfolio of hydrogen refueling and distribution solutions designed for various applications within the transportation sector. Their product line includes:
Hydrogen Refueling Stations: These are designed in semi-custom and modular configurations, allowing for flexibility in deployment. Each compression module can support a capacity of up to 1600 kg/day. The stations are equipped with dispensers for both 350 bar and 700 bar fueling pressures and can integrate point-of-sale (POS) systems or fleet card options. A key design feature is buffered direct-compression, aimed at reducing the physical footprint of the station.12
FleetPilot™ Tactical Fueler: This product is a re-deployable, self-contained fueling station specifically engineered to support pilot programs or initial fleet deployments of up to 10 heavy-duty vehicles. It offers both 350 and 700 bar fueling versions, complete with integrated POS or fleet card options. The standard capacity is 300 kg/day, with the potential for expansion. The FleetPilot™ draws its hydrogen supply from a connected tube trailer and also utilizes buffered direct-compression to minimize its footprint.10
HyLoader™ Tube-Trailer Loader: This system is designed for loading produced hydrogen into tube trailers for bulk distribution. It can accommodate between one and four tube trailer bays simultaneously and features an optimized filling protocol that automatically manages the loading process across active bays. The HyLoader™ can achieve delivery pressures of up to 550 bar.12
A significant aspect of Hyfluence's approach is the in-house development of all key subsystems. This includes the compression package, dispenser, pre-cooling with chiller, and point-of-sale systems. The company emphasizes that these subsystems are fully integrated and undergo end-to-end testing to ensure maximum reliability, performance, and usability.12 This vertical integration provides Hyfluence with greater control over its technology stack but concurrently places the full responsibility for the security of these custom-developed and integrated OT components squarely on the company. While offering an advantage for implementing security measures from the ground up, it also means that if security is not a primary focus during the development lifecycle, these custom subsystems could inadvertently introduce unique and potentially uncharacterized attack surfaces. NCC Group can offer valuable expertise in securing these bespoke OT components and assisting Hyfluence in integrating robust security practices into their product development lifecycle.
Key Features: Capacity, Pressure, Compliance (e.g., J2601-5):
Hyfluence's products are designed to meet various industry demands, featuring dispensing pressures of 350 and/or 700 bar to accommodate different vehicle types.11 A critical aspect of their product specification is compliance with industry standards. The FleetPilot™ Tactical Fueler, for instance, is designed to meet the newly released SAE J2601-5 TIR fueling protocol, which is particularly important for safe high-speed fueling of growing fleet deployments.10 Their general refueling stations also adhere to J2601 compliance for reliable fueling.12
While adherence to standards like SAE J2601-5 53 is essential for ensuring safe and efficient fueling operations and interoperability, these standards typically focus on the physical and process aspects of fueling rather than the cybersecurity of the station's underlying control systems or network infrastructure. A hydrogen refueling station could be fully compliant with SAE J2601 for its fueling protocol yet remain vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, compromise safety interlocks, or manipulate data. This distinction is crucial because industrial standards for functional safety and operational protocols often do not inherently address the specific cybersecurity risks posed by increasingly connected and automated systems. This common gap presents an opportunity for NCC Group to educate Hyfluence on the complementary nature of operational standards and cybersecurity frameworks, highlighting that J2601 compliance is necessary but not sufficient for achieving comprehensive cyber resilience in their critical infrastructure deployments.
Manufacturing Capacity and Process:
All Hyfluence equipment is produced at the company's manufacturing facility located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.7 The company has indicated plans to scale up these manufacturing operations in BC, with an initial target timeframe starting in 2024.7
Manufacturing critical components and systems in-house provides Hyfluence with significant control over quality and the supply chain. However, as the company scales up its manufacturing capabilities 7, the security of its own production environment—the OT security of its manufacturing lines—will become increasingly critical. This includes safeguarding against the introduction of vulnerabilities during the manufacturing process or through compromised components sourced from their own suppliers. A compromised manufacturing environment or a vulnerable component in their supply chain could lead to widespread issues in the products deployed to customer sites. NCC Group can offer services to secure Hyfluence's manufacturing OT environment and provide advisory on implementing robust supply chain risk management practices.
2.2. Technical Infrastructure
Control Systems: PLCs, SCADA, HMIs:
Hyfluence's product descriptions refer to "Smart compressor utilization controls" and "Distributed, networked controls for simplified site installation".12 Given the nature of automated industrial processes like hydrogen refueling, which involve precise control of pressure, flow, and safety interlocks, it is highly probable that their systems utilize Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for real-time control. Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) would be essential for on-site operation, monitoring, and diagnostics. The mention of "distributed, networked controls" and a "cloud-based data/station network management system" strongly suggests the implementation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)-like architecture for centralized monitoring, data logging, and potentially remote management of their fueling stations.99
The adoption of "distributed, networked controls" and a "cloud-based data/station network management system" 12 inherently creates an OT/IT converged environment. This convergence, while offering significant operational benefits such as remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and centralized oversight, also substantially expands the system's attack surface compared to traditional, isolated OT systems. Such interconnectedness is a known target for sophisticated threat actors like VOLTZITE, who specialize in exploiting converged environments to gain access to critical OT systems.79 This represents a primary area of concern for Hyfluence and a key opportunity for engagement by NCC-Dragos, whose expertise lies in securing these complex, converged industrial environments.
Network Architecture: Distributed, Networked Controls; Cloud-Based Data/Station Network Management System:
The explicit mention of "Distributed, networked controls for simplified site installation" and a "Cloud-based data/station network management system" confirms Hyfluence's adoption of modern, interconnected architectures for its fueling stations.12 This type of architecture facilitates remote monitoring, diagnostics, software updates, and potentially remote control capabilities. While these features enhance operational efficiency and maintainability, they also introduce significant cybersecurity risks if not implemented with robust security measures. These risks include unauthorized access to control systems, breaches of sensitive operational data, and the potential for malware to propagate across the network or from the cloud to field devices. The specific cloud provider utilized by Hyfluence (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, or a private cloud solution) is not publicly specified, but the choice would directly influence the security considerations and the shared responsibility model for securing the cloud environment.30
The "cloud-based data/station network management system" 12 is a particularly critical asset and, consequently, a high-value target for adversaries. Its security hinges on multiple factors: the inherent security features of the chosen cloud platform, Hyfluence's secure configuration of cloud services, stringent access control mechanisms (including multi-factor authentication), comprehensive data encryption (both in transit and at rest), and the security of all communication pathways between the individual fueling stations and the central cloud platform. A compromise of this central management system could potentially affect multiple deployed stations, leading to widespread operational disruption, exposure of sensitive customer or operational data, or even unauthorized manipulation of station controls. NCC Group's expertise in cloud security posture assessment (CSPA) and secure cloud architecture review would be highly relevant for mitigating these risks.
Communication Protocols (Industrial & IT):
While Hyfluence does not explicitly detail the specific communication protocols used within its systems, industry norms for such OT environments typically include protocols like Modbus, PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, or OPC UA for communication between PLCs, sensors, and other industrial devices.107 For connectivity to IT networks and cloud platforms, protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP/S, and increasingly MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) are common.107 It is mentioned that their systems are compliant with SAE J2601, and for fueling with communications, this standard is used in conjunction with SAE J2799, "Hydrogen Surface Vehicle to Station Communications Hardware and Software," which often involves Infrared Data Association (IrDA) for data exchange between the vehicle and the station.97
The choice of communication protocols significantly impacts the security posture. Legacy industrial protocols like Modbus often lack robust, built-in security features such as authentication or encryption, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping, manipulation, or replay attacks if network access is gained. Modern secure protocols such as OPC UA (with its security extensions) or MQTT combined with Transport Layer Security (TLS) are preferable for any communication extending beyond the local OT network, especially for IT/cloud connectivity. The use of SAE J2799 for vehicle-to-station communication 97 introduces a specific interface (IrDA) that, while designed for data exchange to optimize fueling, could present its own set of vulnerabilities if not implemented and secured properly. Any communication interface, regardless of its primary purpose, represents a potential vector for attack if security measures like authentication, data integrity checks, and encryption are not rigorously applied.
Hardware and Software Vendors (Key compression components from Chart Industries/Howden identified; others inferred):
Hyfluence has confirmed partnerships with Chart Industries and its subsidiary Howden, who supply "key compression components" for their refueling systems.6 While other specific vendors for PLCs, HMIs, networking equipment, and supervisory software are not publicly disclosed, they would typically be sourced from established industrial automation and IT providers (e.g., Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric for OT components; Cisco, Juniper, etc., for networking).
This reliance on third-party components, whether from major partners like Chart/Howden or for standard off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, introduces supply chain vulnerabilities. A security flaw within a component supplied by Chart/Howden, or a vulnerability in a widely used PLC or HMI software, could directly impact the security and integrity of Hyfluence's deployed systems. If these "key compression components" 16 include embedded controllers, firmware, or software, these elements become integral parts of Hyfluence's OT attack surface. It is crucial for Hyfluence to have a thorough understanding of the security posture of these third-party "black boxes" and to implement appropriate risk management strategies. NCC Group could provide valuable assistance in developing third-party risk management programs and conducting security assessments of supplied components.
Website Technology Stack (hyfluence.co):
The corporate website, hyfluence.co 3, serves as Hyfluence's primary public-facing digital asset. While the provided research snippets do not contain a detailed breakdown of its specific technology stack (e.g., Content Management System (CMS), web server software, analytics tools, hosting provider), such information can typically be identified using publicly available tools like Wappalyzer or Netcraft.10 The security of this website, although not directly part of the OT environment, is important for maintaining brand reputation and preventing its misuse in broader cyberattacks, such as phishing campaigns targeting Hyfluence employees, partners, or customers.

2.3. Security Posture
Stated Security Practices, Compliance, and Certifications:
Hyfluence places a strong emphasis on the physical safety and operational reliability of its systems, highlighted by its "fault-tolerant architectures" and commitment to "high-reliability J2601 compliant fueling".12 The company also notes its team's "perfect accident-free safety record" accumulated over two decades and more than 25 station deliveries prior to founding Hyfluence.21 Adherence to fueling protocols such as SAE J2601-5 TIR is also specified for certain products.10
However, explicit details regarding cybersecurity-specific practices, dedicated cybersecurity certifications (such as ISO 27001 for Information Security Management Systems or ISA/IEC 62443 for Industrial Automation and Control Systems security), or the presence of a dedicated security team or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) are notably absent from the publicly available information.8 This focus on physical and operational safety, while commendable and essential for hydrogen infrastructure, does not inherently translate to a robust cybersecurity posture. In modern converged OT/IT environments, cyber threats can directly lead to physical safety incidents and operational disruptions. The absence of public statements or evidence regarding established cybersecurity frameworks or specialized security personnel suggests a potential maturity gap in Hyfluence's cyber defense capabilities, particularly concerning their OT environments. This represents a significant area where NCC Group can provide value.
Analysis: OT/IT Convergence Risks and Potential Vulnerabilities:
The described architecture of Hyfluence's systems, featuring "distributed, networked controls" and a "cloud-based data/station network management system," inherently signifies a convergence of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT).9 This integration, while offering operational efficiencies like remote monitoring, simplified installation, and centralized data management, also creates pathways for cyber threats to traverse between the traditionally separate IT and OT domains if not architected and secured with meticulous care.140 Common vulnerabilities in such converged environments include inadequate network segmentation, insecure remote access mechanisms, weak authentication protocols, unpatched software in either IT or OT components, and insufficient monitoring of traffic crossing the IT/OT boundary.129 Consequently, vulnerabilities originating in corporate IT systems could potentially be exploited to gain access to critical OT control systems, and conversely, compromised OT systems could impact the broader IT network.
Analysis: Data Security for Cloud-Based Management Systems:
The "cloud-based data/station network management system" is a central component of Hyfluence's technology offering.12 The security of this platform is paramount, as it likely handles sensitive operational data (e.g., station status, fueling logs, diagnostic information) and potentially facilitates control commands or software updates to the deployed fueling stations. A breach of this centralized system could have far-reaching consequences, potentially affecting multiple stations, leading to operational disruptions, exposing confidential customer or operational data, or enabling unauthorized manipulation of station functions. Essential security measures for such a platform include robust data encryption (both in transit and at rest), strong multi-factor authentication for all access, granular role-based access controls, regular security assessments of the cloud environment (including penetration testing and configuration reviews), and secure development practices for the platform's software. General cloud security challenges such as data breaches, misconfigurations, vulnerable APIs, insider threats, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are all pertinent risks that Hyfluence must address.151
Analysis: Known Security Incidents or Disclosures (if any):
The provided research material does not indicate any publicly disclosed security incidents or data breaches specifically involving Hyfluence Systems.11 This is not uncommon for a privately held startup company. However, the absence of public disclosures does not equate to an absence of vulnerabilities or past minor incidents. Many organizations do not publicly report all security events, particularly those that do not meet specific regulatory reporting thresholds or are contained before significant impact. The broader cybersecurity landscape for critical infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT) systems shows a consistent pattern of increasing attacks and discovered vulnerabilities.154 Therefore, a proactive approach to security, informed by industry-wide threat intelligence, is crucial for Hyfluence, rather than a reactive posture that awaits a significant incident.
Opinion: Overall Security Maturity Level (Inferred):
Considering Hyfluence's status as a relatively new startup (founded 2022), its small team size, and its primary focus on rapid product development and market entry, its overall OT cybersecurity maturity is likely in the foundational to developing stages. While the company emphasizes operational reliability and physical safety—which are positive foundational elements—the lack of explicit public information on dedicated cybersecurity personnel, adherence to comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks (like ISA/IEC 62443 or NIST CSF tailored for OT), or specific cyber defense measures suggests that a mature, formalized OT cybersecurity program may not yet be fully established. Startups often prioritize core product features and customer acquisition, with specialized areas like OT security developing more reactively or later in their growth trajectory. This presents a significant opportunity for NCC Group to assist Hyfluence in building and maturing its OT security posture from a relatively early stage, aligning security enhancements with their ongoing growth and system deployments.
2.4. OT Threat Landscape Relevance
Applicability of Threat Actors (VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, ELECTRUM) to Hydrogen Infrastructure:
The threat actors VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, and ELECTRUM, known for their sophisticated attacks targeting critical infrastructure, including the energy sector, pose a direct and credible threat to Hyfluence's hydrogen refueling infrastructure.79 Hydrogen fueling stations are a component of critical energy infrastructure, and their operational technology (OT) environments share many characteristics with those found in traditional oil & gas and electric utility sectors, such as the use of PLCs, SCADA systems, HMIs, and increasingly, networked controls and remote connectivity.
VOLTZITE: This group, with operational overlaps with Volt Typhoon, targets US-based critical infrastructure, including electric power, oil and gas, and telecommunications. VOLTZITE employs "living off the land" (LOTL) techniques, making detection difficult, and focuses on reconnaissance, enumeration, and exfiltration of sensitive OT data such as GIS information, network diagrams, and operational instructions.79 Such intelligence could be invaluable for planning disruptive attacks against hydrogen fueling networks. Their use of compromised SOHO routers and exploitation of internet-facing VPN appliances or firewalls for initial access are relevant TTPs.82
KAMACITE: Known for facilitating ICS-specific operations, including enabling disruptive attacks like the 2015 and 2016 Ukraine power events, KAMACITE acts as an initial access provider for other OT-targeting groups such as ELECTRUM. It has targeted European oil and natural gas organizations, utilizing spear-phishing campaigns and custom malware like the Kapeka backdoor and LummaStealer.79 Their ability to gain footholds in IT networks and then hand off access for OT operations is a significant concern for converged environments like those Hyfluence is deploying.
ELECTRUM: Associated with the Sandworm APT group, ELECTRUM has a documented history of causing disruptive power outages in Ukraine using malware like CRASHOVERRIDE and INDUSTROYER2. They are known for deploying wiper malware (e.g., AcidPour, AcidRain) capable of erasing data or rendering systems inoperable, including embedded devices in OT environments. ELECTRUM also collaborates with hacktivist groups to obscure its operations.79 The potential for such destructive attacks on hydrogen station control systems, which could halt fueling operations or compromise safety mechanisms, is a severe threat.
The tactics employed by these groups—exploiting internet-facing vulnerabilities, spear-phishing, leveraging LOTL techniques, and deploying custom OT malware—are all applicable to the types of systems Hyfluence designs and deploys.
Potential Attack Vectors on Hyfluence's Systems:
Given Hyfluence's technology (networked PLCs, SCADA-like cloud management) and the known TTPs of relevant threat actors, several potential attack vectors can be identified:
Table 4: Potential OT Attack Vectors for Hyfluence Systems
Attack Vector

Addressing these potential attack vectors requires a multi-layered security approach, encompassing network segmentation, robust authentication and access controls, vulnerability management, secure software development practices, continuous monitoring with OT-specific threat detection capabilities, and comprehensive incident response planning. NCC Group and Dragos are well-positioned to assist Hyfluence in developing and implementing such a strategy.


Part 3: Strategic Sales Approach & Battle Card (for NCC Group)
3.1. Identifying Sales Opportunities with Hyfluence
Hyfluence's Business Pains and Needs:
Analysis of Hyfluence's organizational profile, technical infrastructure, and market positioning reveals several key business pains and operational needs that NCC Group can address:
Ensuring High Reliability and Uptime: A core tenet of Hyfluence's value proposition is the delivery of "high-reliability" and "fault-tolerant" hydrogen fueling systems.12 Any operational downtime, whether due to component failure or a cyberattack, directly undermines this promise and can lead to significant financial and reputational damage, especially as their systems support critical transportation fleets. Angela Das's focus on "station reliability" and "getting the design right" underscores this internal priority.38
Protecting Innovative Technology: Hyfluence is developing "next-gen high-reliability hydrogen fueling architectures," including "fault-tolerant architectures" and a "cloud-based data/station network management system".7 Protecting the intellectual property (IP) associated with these innovations and ensuring these advanced systems are not compromised by cyber threats is crucial for maintaining their competitive edge.
Navigating Regulatory Compliance: As Hyfluence expands into the U.S. market, particularly California, and deploys infrastructure that is considered critical, they will face an increasingly complex web of regulations pertaining to cybersecurity and safety.24 Demonstrating adherence to standards like NIST CSF or ISA/IEC 62443 will become increasingly important for market access and customer trust.
Managing Supply Chain Risks: Their reliance on partners like Chart Industries and Howden for key components 16 introduces supply chain risks. Vulnerabilities in third-party components can become vulnerabilities in Hyfluence's own systems.
Addressing Potential Expertise Gaps: As a startup with a relatively small engineering team (around 14 employees) 3, it is unlikely Hyfluence possesses dedicated, specialized in-house OT cybersecurity expertise. This creates a need for external support and guidance.
Safeguarding Brand Reputation and Investor Confidence: Early positive recognitions and successful project deployments are building Hyfluence's brand.62 A security incident could severely damage this nascent reputation, deter customers, and impact current and future investor confidence.3
The fundamental pain point for Hyfluence revolves around maintaining the integrity, availability, and safety of their advanced hydrogen fueling systems in an increasingly complex and hostile cyber threat environment. Their core value proposition of "high-reliability" is directly threatened by potential cyberattacks that could cause downtime, operational failure, or safety incidents. NCC Group can effectively position OT security as an indispensable component for delivering on this core promise, thereby transforming a security discussion into a business enabler conversation.

Leveraging Hyfluence's Partnerships (Chart, Howden) for Entry Points or Broader Engagements:
Hyfluence's collaboration with Chart Industries and Howden for the supply of key compression components presents a strategic avenue for NCC Group.16 These established industrial giants are likely to have their own (potentially stringent) supply chain security requirements or cybersecurity standards for components integrated into their ecosystem or deployed alongside their equipment.
If NCC Group or Dragos has existing relationships with either Chart Industries or Howden, these connections could serve as a warm introduction or referral to Hyfluence. Alternatively, NCC Group can research the typical security expectations or mandates these larger partners impose on their suppliers and smaller collaborators. Understanding these upstream requirements could reveal specific compliance drivers or security needs that Hyfluence must address to maintain these valuable partnerships. NCC Group can then position its services as enabling Hyfluence to meet these partner-mandated obligations, effectively turning a potential compliance burden into a compelling reason for engagement. This approach frames NCC Group not just as a vendor, but as a facilitator of Hyfluence's critical business relationships.
3.2. Competitive Landscape and NCC Group's Differentiation
Hyfluence's Key Competitors and Their Strengths/Weaknesses:
Hyfluence operates in an increasingly competitive hydrogen refueling market. Key competitors identified include Maximator Hydrogen, Hydrogen Projects (a consortium potentially involving Nel ASA, Hexagon Purus, and PowerCell), and Powertech Labs.3 Other notable players in the broader hydrogen infrastructure space include NanoSUN, Protium, Everfuel, H2 MOBILITY, Hydrogen Refueling Solutions (HRS), and HTEC.6
Many of these competitors, such as Cavendish Hydrogen (formerly Nel Fueling) 158, Hexagon Purus 163, and industrial gas giants like Air Liquide and Linde (mentioned in market reports as dominant players 65), are larger, more established entities with potentially greater resources for R&D, manufacturing, and market penetration. These larger organizations may already possess more mature OT security programs or even offer certain security features as part of their standard solutions. For example, Powertech Labs highlights its world-class high-pressure hydrogen testing facilities supporting its station designs and its ability to identify reliable high-pressure components.168 Cavendish Hydrogen emphasizes its control over the full value chain from product development to service, with a focus on safety, reliability, and compliance with standards like ISO 9001 and specific fueling protocols.158 Hexagon Purus offers mobile and stationary refueling systems, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and flexibility, with features like 24/7 remote monitoring.163 HRS provides a range of modular stations and highlights safety, reliability, and comprehensive support.172 HTEC offers engineering, design services, and specialty products across the hydrogen value chain.176 NanoSUN, in partnership with Westfalen, offers the "Pioneer" mobile hydrogen filling station, emphasizing a rugged, simple design with remote maintenance capabilities.180
Hyfluence's differentiation likely stems from its specific technological innovations, such as its "fault-tolerant architectures," "cloud-based management system," agility as a startup, and the deep expertise of its leadership team. If competitors are actively promoting their security posture or embedding security features into their products, Hyfluence could face a competitive disadvantage if it does not visibly prioritize and invest in robust OT security. NCC Group can assist Hyfluence in achieving at least parity, or potentially a competitive advantage, by bolstering its OT security measures and helping them articulate this enhanced security as a value proposition to their customers.

"Cloud provider handles security": Clarify shared responsibility model; focus on securing in the cloud.
Relevant (Generic/Anonymized) Success Stories/Case Studies:
"NCC Group helped a renewable energy provider secure their distributed generation assets by implementing OT network monitoring and vulnerability management, significantly reducing their risk of disruption."
"Dragos identified and helped neutralize a state-sponsored threat actor targeting the control systems of a North American utility, preventing potential widespread outages."
"Working with an industrial equipment manufacturer, NCC Group embedded security into their product development lifecycle, resulting in more resilient products and reduced post-deployment vulnerabilities."
"Now/Next/Never" Framework for Hyfluence Engagement:
Now (Immediate Opportunities - Foundational Security):
OT Security Risk Assessment: Comprehensive assessment of a deployed station (e.g., Lewis County or Avina site if accessible post-deployment, or their R&D/manufacturing setup) to identify key vulnerabilities and establish a baseline.
Threat Modeling Workshop: For their "next-gen" architectures to identify potential threats and security requirements early in the design.
Cloud Security Posture Assessment (CSPA): For their "cloud-based data/station network management system."
Executive Briefing on OT Threat Landscape: Educate leadership on relevant threats (VOLTZITE, etc.) and potential impacts.
Next (Medium-Term Opportunities - Building Resilience):
Dragos Platform Deployment (Pilot/PoC): Implement the Dragos Platform at a key facility or on a new deployment for continuous OT visibility and threat detection.
Secure Product Development Lifecycle (SPDLC) Integration: Consulting to embed security into Hyfluence's R&D and engineering processes.
OT Incident Response Plan Development & Tabletop Exercise: Prepare Hyfluence for potential cyber incidents.
Vulnerability Management Program Development: Establish processes for ongoing identification and remediation of OT vulnerabilities.
Network Segmentation Design & Implementation Support: For their station architectures and converged environments.
Never (Likely Not a Fit / Low Priority for Hyfluence at this stage):
Extensive, enterprise-wide IT security services (unless a major IT-related pain point is uncovered that directly impacts OT). Their primary need is OT-focused.
Highly complex, multi-year security transformation programs typically suited for very large, mature enterprises (Hyfluence is still a startup).
Solutions that do not demonstrate clear ROI or direct relevance to OT reliability, safety, or core business objectives.
Conclusions & Recommendations
Hyfluence Systems Corp. represents a promising innovator in the critical hydrogen refueling infrastructure sector. Their experienced leadership, focus on high-reliability technology, and early market successes position them for growth. However, their status as an early-stage company with a small team, coupled with the inherent complexities and connectivity of their systems (networked controls, cloud-based management), creates a significant, likely under-addressed, OT cybersecurity risk. The direct applicability of threat actors like VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, and ELECTRUM to their operational environment underscores the urgency of this risk.
NCC Group, leveraging its specialized OT security expertise and the advanced capabilities of the Dragos Platform, is uniquely positioned to partner with Hyfluence. The primary opportunity lies in helping Hyfluence mature its OT security posture from a foundational level, aligning security initiatives with their core business objectives of reliability, safety, and innovation.
Key Recommendations for NCC Group Sales Engagement:
Target Key Leadership with Tailored Messaging: Engage CEO Ron Klopfer on strategic risk, enterprise value, and investor confidence. Approach CTO Angela Das with a technical focus on enhancing system reliability and integrating security into new designs. Connect with engineering leads on practical implementation and operational security.
Frame OT Security as a Business Enabler: Position cybersecurity not as a cost, but as an essential investment that underpins Hyfluence's core value proposition of reliability, protects their IP, ensures customer trust, facilitates market access (especially in regulated US markets), and safeguards their growing reputation.
Prioritize "Now" Opportunities: Focus initial engagement on foundational services with clear, immediate value:
Conducting an OT Security Risk Assessment of their current systems or R&D environment.
Performing a Cloud Security Posture Assessment for their station management platform.
Offering a Threat Modeling Workshop for their "next-gen" architectures.
Providing an Executive Briefing on the specific OT threat landscape relevant to hydrogen infrastructure.
Highlight NCC-Dragos Differentiators: Emphasize the deep OT-specific expertise, actionable threat intelligence (VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, ELECTRUM), the purpose-built Dragos Platform, and the holistic approach to cyber-physical security.
Leverage Industry Context and Partnerships: Use Hyfluence's recent project wins and partnerships (Lewis County, Avina, Chart Industries, Howden) as entry points, discussing the heightened security and compliance expectations that come with deploying critical infrastructure and collaborating with larger industrial partners.
Address Potential Objections Proactively: Be prepared to discuss the ROI of early security investment, the distinction between physical safety and cybersecurity, and the shared responsibility model in cloud environments.
Propose a Phased Approach: Given Hyfluence's startup nature, suggest a scalable, phased approach to building their OT security program, starting with foundational assessments and gradually implementing more advanced detection, response, and management capabilities.
By focusing on Hyfluence's specific pain points, technological architecture, and strategic objectives, NCC Group can effectively demonstrate the value of a robust OT cybersecurity program, positioning itself as a long-term partner in their growth and success in the expanding hydrogen economy.
