Go-to-Market Analysis: EVERSOURCE ENERGY
I. Overall Executive Summary
Strategic Overview of EVERSOURCE ENERGY:
Eversource Energy is a prominent, publicly traded utility holding company with a significant presence in the New England energy sector. The company is currently navigating a period of substantial strategic realignment, divesting non-core assets, specifically its offshore wind generation ventures and its Aquarion water utility business. This strategic pivot aims to concentrate Eversource's focus and capital on its core regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution operations. With a large customer base exceeding 4 million across Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, and managing extensive infrastructure, Eversource plays a critical role in the region's energy delivery and economic stability. The company's long history, formed through numerous mergers and acquisitions, has established it as New England's largest energy delivery company, committed to providing safe, reliable, and increasingly sustainable energy solutions.
Key Findings: Organizational, Technical, and Security Posture:
Organizational: Eversource Energy is steered by an experienced leadership team navigating significant strategic shifts. These changes, particularly the divestitures, are intended to strengthen the balance sheet and allow for focused investment in core utility operations. This refocus may influence internal priorities, resource allocation, and potentially create new demands on existing IT and operational teams. The organizational structure reflects a centralized service model for its various state-level operating companies, with a clear brand unification.
Technical: The company is actively engaged in digital transformation initiatives, including the implementation of a new SAP Customer Information System (CIS) and the rollout of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in Massachusetts. These modernizations coexist with what is likely a complex environment of legacy systems, a common challenge stemming from its extensive merger and acquisition history. Eversource operates substantial Operational Technology (OT) environments critical to its electric grid and natural gas distribution networks. These OT systems are central to grid modernization efforts and the integration of clean energy resources, presenting both opportunities for technological advancement and complex cybersecurity challenges.
Security Posture: Eversource acknowledges its vulnerability to cyberattacks, a significant concern for critical infrastructure entities. The company has established IT and security leadership, including a Chief Information Officer (CIO) and a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). However, the specific maturity of its OT security posture, especially in light of ongoing grid modernization and the increasing connectivity of industrial control systems, remains a crucial area for detailed assessment and enhancement.
Core Sales Opportunities for NCC Group (Highlighting OT Security & NCC-Dragos):
The current strategic trajectory and technical landscape at Eversource Energy present several key opportunities for NCC Group. The divestiture of non-core assets and the sharpened focus on regulated transmission and distribution operations will necessitate significant investment in the reliability, resilience, and security of this core infrastructure.
Key opportunities include:
Securing Digital Transformation Initiatives: The new SAP CIS and AMI rollouts introduce new digital assets and connectivity that require robust cybersecurity measures from design through deployment and operation.
Enhancing OT Security for Core Infrastructure: As Eversource invests heavily in grid modernization, clean energy integration (such as solar, geothermal, and future energy hubs like Huntsbrook), and upgrades to its aging electric and gas T&D networks, the need to secure these expanding and evolving OT environments becomes paramount. This is a prime area for NCC Group's specialized OT security assessment, advisory, and implementation services.
Leveraging the NCC-Dragos Partnership: The NCC-Dragos joint capabilities are particularly well-suited to address Eversource's complex OT footprint. This includes comprehensive threat detection, vulnerability management specific to industrial control systems (ICS), and specialized OT incident response planning and execution.
Addressing Regulatory Compliance: Eversource operates under stringent regulatory oversight (FERC, NERC CIP, state PUCs/PURAs) that mandates high levels of reliability and security. NCC Group can assist in ensuring that security measures meet or exceed these regulatory requirements, particularly for critical OT assets.
Supporting M&A Driven System Integration: While currently divesting, Eversource's history is rich with acquisitions. Should future acquisitions occur in its core business, NCC Group can provide cybersecurity due diligence and post-merger integration support.
Top-Level Engagement Recommendations:
Approaching Eversource Energy effectively requires a nuanced understanding of its current strategic priorities and operational realities.
Align with Strategic Risk Reduction: Frame NCC Group's offerings in terms of mitigating risks to Eversource's core strategic objectives: reliability of energy delivery, security of critical infrastructure, successful execution of its multi-billion dollar capital investment plan, and maintaining customer trust.
Demonstrate Understanding of Regulatory Pressures: Acknowledge the complex regulatory environment Eversource navigates and highlight how NCC Group's solutions can help meet and manage compliance obligations efficiently.
Target Key Decision-Makers: Engage with leadership in both IT/Security (CIO Ron Utterbeck, CISO Christopher Leigh) and operational leadership (COO Paul Chodak III), as well as executives responsible for strategy and customer experience. Given the dual HR/IT oversight of EVP Susan Sgroi, she is also a key contact regarding IT initiatives and talent.
Focus on OT Specialization: Emphasize NCC Group's deep expertise in OT security, particularly the advanced capabilities offered through the Dragos partnership, as this directly addresses the security needs of Eversource's core T&D assets and modernization projects.
II. Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
A. Executive Summary (Part 1 Focus)
Eversource Energy stands as a major utility holding company in New England, providing electric, natural gas, and, until a pending sale is finalized, water services to approximately 4.4 million customers across Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.1 The company, publicly traded on the NYSE under the ticker ES 4, has a complex history rooted in the merger of numerous predecessor entities dating back to the 19th century, culminating in its current form and 2015 rebranding from Northeast Utilities.3
Recent strategic developments signify a deliberate pivot towards its core regulated energy transmission and distribution businesses. This includes the completed divestiture of its offshore wind generation assets and the announced sale of its Aquarion water utility division.8 These moves are aimed at simplifying the corporate structure, strengthening the balance sheet, and focusing capital on modernizing its extensive electric and gas networks.8 This strategic refocus will likely drive significant technology and security investments in its core operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) environments.
The leadership team, headed by Chairman, President, and CEO Joseph R. Nolan, Jr. 11, is experienced and guiding this transformation. The Board of Trustees provides oversight, with key committees like Audit and Finance playing roles in approving major expenditures and risk management strategies, including those related to cybersecurity.13
Competitively, Eversource is one of the largest utilities in New England, alongside National Grid and Avangrid.15 Its corporate culture emphasizes reliability, customer service, sustainability, and community engagement.3 Understanding this evolving organizational context, leadership priorities, and cultural values is crucial for tailoring effective engagement strategies.
B. Detailed Organizational Profile
1. Organization Overview
Full legal name and corporate structure:
The full legal name of the company is EVERSOURCE ENERGY.19 It is structured as a public utility holding company.2 The 2024 10-K, filed on February 14, 2025, confirms that Eversource Energy is a Massachusetts voluntary association.19 This holding company structure is fundamental to its operations, influencing financial management, strategic direction, and regulatory interactions across its various operating subsidiaries.
Principal Operating Subsidiaries: Eversource Energy operates through several wholly-owned subsidiaries, many of which do business as (dba) Eversource Energy, presenting a unified brand to customers despite being distinct legal and regulatory entities.20 Key subsidiaries include:
The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), dba Eversource Energy: Responsible for electric distribution and transmission services in Connecticut.19
NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), dba Eversource Energy: An electric utility serving Massachusetts. Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) was merged into NSTAR Electric Company on December 31, 2017.19
Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), dba Eversource Energy: New Hampshire’s largest electric utility.19
Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), dba Eversource Energy: Connecticut's largest natural gas distribution company.20
NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), dba Eversource Energy: A natural gas distribution company serving Massachusetts.20
Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), dba Eversource Energy: Another natural gas distribution company serving Massachusetts, which acquired substantially all assets of Bay State Gas Company on October 9, 2020.20
Aquarion Company (AC): A holding company for Eversource Energy’s water businesses, including Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, and The Torrington Water Company. This entire division is pending sale to the Aquarion Water Authority, expected to close in late 2025.9
Eversource Energy Service Company (EESC): Provides centralized accounting, administrative, information resources, engineering, financial, legal, regulatory,...source to Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries.20
The pending sale of Aquarion Company signifies a strategic move to streamline Eversource's structure, allowing it to concentrate on its core energy delivery operations.
Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations:
Year Founded: Eversource Energy traces its origins to predecessor companies founded in the 19th century.3 The entity Northeast Utilities, its direct predecessor, was incorporated in 1927 6 and formally created through mergers on July 1, 1966.4 The company adopted the name Eversource Energy in April 2015.6
Headquarters Location: Eversource Energy maintains dual headquarters. The primary corporate address listed in its 2024 10-K is 300 Cadwell Drive, Springfield, Massachusetts 01104.4 It also has a significant corporate presence in Hartford, Connecticut.15
Significant Operational Locations: The company's operations are spread extensively across Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, serving numerous cities and towns detailed in company service maps.1 Key infrastructure includes not only its vast network of power lines and pipelines but also facilities related to its (now divested) offshore wind interests like South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind, and planned developments such as the Huntsbrook Energy Hub in southeastern Connecticut.8 The long and varied history of its constituent companies suggests a geographically dispersed and potentially technologically diverse asset base.
Organizational history and key milestones:
Eversource Energy's lineage is marked by a series of significant mergers and acquisitions. Its roots extend to companies like Connecticut Light and Power Company (founded 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (founded 1886), and Hartford Electric Light Company, which merged in 1966 to form Northeast Utilities (NU).7 Other historical entities like Holyoke Water Power Company (founded 1859) and Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH, founded 1926) were later integrated into the NU system.7
A pivotal merger occurred in April 2012 when Northeast Utilities combined with NSTAR, a major electric and gas provider in Greater Boston.7 NSTAR itself was the result of prior consolidations involving Boston Edison Company, Cambridge Electric Light Company, Commonwealth Electric Company, Commonwealth Gas, and Cambridge Gas Company.7
The unified brand Eversource Energy was adopted in February/April 2015, consolidating the identities of its various operating companies.6
In 2017, Eversource expanded into the water utility sector by acquiring Aquarion Water Company.7
This extensive history of M&A is a critical factor in understanding Eversource's current operational landscape. Each acquired entity likely possessed its own distinct IT and OT systems, contributing to a heterogeneous technological environment. The integration and modernization of these disparate systems present ongoing challenges and opportunities, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity and operational efficiency.
Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):
Primary Business Activities: Eversource Energy is primarily engaged in the energy delivery business. This encompasses the transmission and distribution of electricity, the distribution of natural gas, and (pending completion of its sale) the provision of water services to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.2
NAICS Codes:
The primary registered NAICS code for Eversource Energy Service Company is 221122 (Electric Power Distribution).25
It is also associated with 221210 (Natural Gas Distribution).25
SIC Codes:
The primary SIC code identified is 4911 (Electric Services).26
Related SIC code includes 4924 (Natural Gas Distribution), inferred from its NAICS code and business activities.26
These classifications firmly place Eversource within the critical infrastructure sector, subjecting it to specific industry regulations (such as NERC CIP for electric transmission assets) and a heightened focus on cybersecurity and operational resilience.
Precise company size metrics:
Annual Revenue (Year-End December 31):
2024: $11.90 billion.10
2023: $11.91 billion.28
2022: $12.29 billion.38
The revenues show a period of stability with a slight decrease, reflecting market conditions and perhaps initial impacts of strategic repositioning. The company's divestitures are aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on regulated growth in its core utility segments.
Employee Count:
As of year-end 2024, Eversource Energy employed 10,680 individuals.4 Other sources provide similar figures around 10,000.1
While specific departmental breakdowns are not readily available, career areas span Corporate Relations, Customer Group, Clean Energy/Energy Efficiency, Strategy/Business Development, Finance/HR/Legal, IT, Operations, Engineering, Transmission, and Supply Chain/Procurement.1
A large, geographically dispersed workforce across three states underscores the need for robust internal IT infrastructure, communication systems, and comprehensive cybersecurity awareness programs.
Market Capitalization:
As of June 2025, Eversource Energy's market capitalization was approximately $23.75 - $24.12 billion.5
This valuation places it as a large-cap company, indicative of its significant scale and resources, but also presenting a correspondingly larger attack surface and higher visibility to potential threat actors.
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
Eversource projects a long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029, using its 2024 non-GAAP EPS as the baseline.10 For 2025, revenue growth is forecast at approximately 3.6% to $13.1 billion, with a significant projected increase in EPS.47 First-quarter 2025 EPS was reported at $1.50.28
The company's financial trajectory is heavily influenced by its strategic decision to divest its offshore wind assets 8 and the Aquarion water business.9 This refocus on becoming a "pure-play pipes and wires regulated utility" 45 is designed to achieve stable, predictable earnings growth, driven by investments in its core regulated operations. Such a strategy typically involves navigating stringent regulatory environments that demand high reliability and security standards.
Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations:
Eversource Energy's operational footprint spans Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.1 The company serves approximately 4.4 million electric, natural gas, and (pending sale) water customers.1
Connecticut: Provides electricity to 1.3 million customers in 157 cities and towns, natural gas to 254,000 customers in 85 communities, and water services to approximately 225,000 customers in 60 communities (via Aquarion).42
Massachusetts: Serves over 1.4 million electric customers in 140 communities and over 300,000 natural gas customers in 51 communities.27
New Hampshire: Is the largest electric utility, serving over 500,000 customers in 211 cities and towns.27
Detailed lists of specific towns and cities served for electric and gas in Connecticut and Massachusetts are available.30 The extensive and dispersed nature of its service territories presents significant logistical and security challenges for managing IT and OT infrastructure, particularly for remote substations, pipelines, and distribution assets.
Detailed corporate structure including:
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: Eversource Energy functions as the parent holding company for its various operating utilities and service companies.2 Key operating subsidiaries, as previously detailed, include CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas, EGMA, and the Aquarion group of water companies (pending sale). Eversource Energy Service Company (EESC) plays a crucial role by providing centralized shared services, including IT, finance, and legal, to the entire group.20
Business Units and Divisions: The company is primarily segmented by utility type (Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution, and Water Distribution) and further by state-specific operating companies.6 The 2024 10-K provides detailed segment reporting.10
Recent Restructuring Initiatives:
Offshore Wind Divestiture: A significant restructuring involved the complete exit from offshore wind investments. This included agreements to sell its 50% share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for approximately $1.1 billion in cash (announced February 2024, expected to close mid-2024) 8, and its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project to Ørsted (announced January 2024).8 Additionally, its 50% interest in an uncommitted offshore lease area was sold to Ørsted for $625 million (closed September 2023).8 This strategic exit allows Eversource to focus on its core transmission and distribution businesses.8
Aquarion Water Company Sale: Eversource entered into a definitive agreement in January 2025 to sell its entire Aquarion Water Company division to the Aquarion Water Authority, a quasi-public corporation in Connecticut, for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion (comprising $1.6 billion in cash and $800 million of net debt extinguishment).9 The sale is expected to close in late 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.
These divestitures represent a fundamental strategic shift. CEO Joe Nolan has articulated the goal of transforming Eversource into a "pure-play regulated utility company" 28, concentrating on its strengths as a "regulated transmission builder and operator".8 The proceeds from these sales are earmarked for paying down parent company debt and strengthening the balance sheet, thereby supporting focused investment in core energy delivery networks.8 This sharpened focus on core T&D assets, which are heavily reliant on OT systems, implies an increased need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect these critical investments.
Other Initiatives: Eversource is also pursuing customer-facing initiatives such as a proposed seasonal heat pump rate in Massachusetts to encourage electrification and manage costs 41, and the "Main Streets" program in Connecticut to promote energy efficiency for small businesses.42
Merger and Acquisition History: As detailed previously, Eversource's history is one of extensive consolidation, including the formation of Northeast Utilities, the NU-NSTAR merger, and acquisitions of PSNH, Yankee Energy, and Aquarion Water Company (which itself made acquisitions like Torrington Water and New England Service Company).7 This history underscores the complexity of its integrated systems.
Ownership structure:
Public Trading Information: Eversource Energy is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ES.2
Major Shareholders: The company's ownership is predominantly institutional, with estimates ranging from 66% to 80%.16 Leading institutional shareholders include The Vanguard Group (holding approximately 11.44-12.16%), BlackRock, Inc. (around 10.57%), State Street Corp (approximately 7.25%), and Wellington Management Group LLP (around 4.49%).52 Such significant institutional ownership typically translates to heightened scrutiny of financial performance, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, and overall risk management, including cybersecurity.
Private Equity Ownership: Not applicable, as Eversource is a publicly traded entity.
Recent Ownership Changes: Ownership changes primarily reflect standard fluctuations in institutional holdings. Notably, Eversource announced a $1.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering effective May 2025.53 This follows a completed ATM equity program in 2024, which issued approximately 15.7 million common shares for net proceeds of $989.4 million.10 These equity offerings are instrumental in funding the company's substantial $24.17 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025-2029 10, further emphasizing the scale of infrastructure investments that will require robust cybersecurity.

C. In-Depth Leadership Analysis
1. Executive Leadership Team
The strategic direction and day-to-day operations of Eversource Energy are guided by a C-suite of experienced executives. Their backgrounds, current responsibilities, and stated priorities offer valuable context for understanding the company's focus areas, including technology and security. The official list of executive officers and their detailed biographies are typically found in the company's annual Proxy Statement (DEF 14A).14
Joseph R. Nolan, Jr.: Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Nolan (Age 61) has been Chairman since 2022 and President & CEO since 2021.4 He is also a Trustee since 2021.14 His tenure at Eversource includes prior roles such as Executive Vice President-Strategy, Customer & Corporate Relations.14 He holds a BA in Communications and an MBA from Boston College.14 Mr. Nolan is the primary architect of Eversource's strategic pivot towards a pure-play regulated utility, overseeing the divestiture of offshore wind and water assets.8 His focus is on strengthening the balance sheet, investing in core T&D infrastructure, enhancing customer service, supporting the clean energy transition, and engaging with regulatory bodies.8
John M. Moreira: Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer
Mr. Moreira became CFO on May 4, 2022, succeeding Phil Lembo.11 He is a long-term veteran of Eversource and its predecessor companies, with over 22 years of service, and previously held the role of Senior Vice President - Finance and Regulatory, and Treasurer since 2018.58 He is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and holds an MBA from Curry College and a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth.58 His key responsibilities include managing the company's financial strategy, funding its significant capital investment program (currently $24.17 billion for 2025-2029 10), overseeing treasury functions, and navigating the financial implications of the company's strategic divestitures and regulatory engagements.45
Paul Chodak III: Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer
Mr. Chodak joined Eversource as EVP & COO effective November 13, 2023.11 He brought 22 years of experience from American Electric Power (AEP), where he served as EVP of Generation (responsible for wind, solar, hydro) and previously as EVP of Utilities, leading operations across 11 states.59 His educational background includes a Doctorate in Nuclear Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a Master's degree in Environmental Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Susan L. Sgroi: Executive Vice President, Human Resources & Information Technology
Ms. Sgroi was elected to this dual EVP role effective January 8, 2024, succeeding the retiring Chris Carmody.11 Prior to Eversource, she was the EVP and Chief Human Resources Officer at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts since 2015. Her earlier career includes nine years as EVP of Human Resources for Fidelity Investment's Asset Management Company and six years as EVP of Human Resources for Citizens Bank Financial Group.62 Ms. Sgroi holds a Master's degree in Organizational Development from American University and a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Bowdoin College.62 Her broad mandate covers business transformation, mergers and acquisitions support, technology strategy and implementation (including IT infrastructure and cybersecurity from an IT perspective), organizational effectiveness, compensation and benefits, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, labor relations, culture change, talent management, and leadership succession.62 The combination of HR and IT under one EVP is a significant structural aspect. This suggests a strong emphasis on aligning technology initiatives with workforce strategy, talent development (especially for critical IT and cybersecurity roles), and fostering a culture that supports digital transformation.
Gregory B. Butler: Executive Vice President & General Counsel
Mr. Butler has served as EVP and General Counsel since August 2016, and General Counsel since May 2012.11 His history with Eversource and its predecessors is extensive, including roles as President of The Connecticut Light and Power Company and Senior Vice President & General Counsel at various subsidiaries.64 He holds a JD from Albany Law School and a BA in History from Stony Brook University.63 His responsibilities encompass all legal affairs, regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and support for M&A activities and strategic initiatives.
James W. Hunt III: Executive Vice President of Corporate Relations & Sustainability and Secretary
Mr. Hunt holds this key role focusing on external affairs, sustainability initiatives, and corporate secretarial duties.11 His role is critical in managing stakeholder relationships and advancing Eversource's sustainability agenda.
Penelope McLean-Conner: Executive Vice President of Customer Experience & Energy Strategy
Ms. McLean-Conner leads efforts to enhance customer interactions and develop strategies related to energy services and evolving customer needs.11 This role is increasingly important as utilities navigate digital transformation and changing consumer expectations.
The consolidation of Human Resources and Information Technology under a single Executive Vice President, Susan Sgroi, is a noteworthy organizational design choice. Typically, these functions are led by separate C-level executives (e.g., CHRO and CIO). This integrated structure at Eversource may indicate a strategic emphasis on talent as a critical component of IT and digital success, a drive for greater efficiency in aligning HR processes with IT systems and security protocols, or an effort to embed IT strategy within broader organizational and cultural transformation initiatives. Given the recognized skills gap in cybersecurity, this tight coupling of HR and IT could also facilitate more agile and effective responses to talent acquisition and development needs in this crucial area. For NCC Group, this means Ms. Sgroi is a key executive for discussions related to IT/security strategy, cybersecurity awareness training, security team staffing, and skills development.
Furthermore, the appointment of Paul Chodak III as COO brings an individual with substantial and directly relevant OT experience to a critical operational leadership role. His background at American Electric Power, managing diverse generation assets (including renewables) and extensive utility operations, combined with his advanced engineering degrees, suggests a sophisticated understanding of complex energy systems and their operational intricacies.59 His direct oversight of electric T&D, gas operations, engineering, grid modernization, and safety—all heavily reliant on OT—makes him a vital stakeholder for OT security initiatives. NCC Group's value proposition concerning the security, reliability, and safety of OT environments should resonate strongly with his priorities and technical acumen.

5. Decision-Making Patterns
Analysis: Major technology and cybersecurity investments, particularly those with significant capital outlay such as the SAP CIS implementation or the AMI rollout 45, would necessitate a multi-layered approval process. This would typically involve the CIO (Ron Utterbeck) and CISO (Christopher Leigh) for technical and security validation, relevant business unit Vice Presidents or Presidents (e.g., President of MA Electric Operations for a Massachusetts-specific system), and ultimately the EVP of HR & IT (Susan Sgroi), the CFO (John M. Moreira), and the CEO (Joseph R. Nolan) for final approval of major expenditures. The Board of Directors, through its Audit and Finance committees, would provide oversight and approval for substantial investments and associated risk management strategies.
The strategic divestitures of the offshore wind and water businesses 8 clearly demonstrate that fundamental strategic decisions are made at the highest executive echelons (CEO, CFO, COO) and receive Board approval, underscoring a centralized approach to major portfolio changes.
Given Eversource's status as a regulated utility, approvals from state Public Utilities Commissions (PUCs) or Public Utilities Regulatory Authorities (PURAs) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), are critical prerequisites for many initiatives. This includes rate adjustments, large-scale infrastructure projects, and programs like the proposed seasonal heat pump rate.9 This regulatory dependency creates a strong imperative for solutions that not only meet operational needs but also satisfy stringent compliance and public interest mandates. Technology and security solutions that can demonstrate clear benefits for reliability, safety, customer affordability, and regulatory compliance are more likely to gain traction.

Stated Mission, Vision, and Values:
Eversource's stated mission, as found on Comparably, is centered on "delivering reliable energy and superior customer service in our daily work, in community service and leadership, and in doing the right thing for our customers, co-workers, shareholders and the environment".18
While a formal vision statement is not explicitly provided in the snippets, the company's public messaging and initiatives suggest a vision focused on "powering the possible for New England" through safe, reliable, and sustainable energy delivery, strong community support, and leadership in the clean energy transition.3 The tagline "Energy Brings Us Together" also encapsulates a core cultural theme.3
Key values emphasized include reliability, safety, sustainability, customer service, community engagement, innovation, teamwork, collaboration, and fostering an engaged, respectful workforce.3 Job postings highlight a "performance-oriented culture" and a "legacy of doing good work for our communities".96
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiatives:
Eversource has extensive CSR programs. These are deeply integrated into its business strategy and focus on sustainability, addressing climate change, promoting energy efficiency, supporting local communities (including economic development and STEM education), and fostering workforce development.3 A specific initiative, "Energizing a Just Transition," aims to ensure equity in the benefits of the clean energy transition, particularly for underrepresented and environmentally overburdened communities, by involving them in infrastructure planning and providing access to clean energy solutions.102
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Programs:
Eversource has historically highlighted its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), with CEO Joe Nolan previously calling such programs "key to our ability to meet our customers' needs" and foster a welcoming workplace.103 However, in early-mid 2025, reports indicated that public-facing references to "DEI" on the company website and its 2023 DEI report were removed or redirected. This shift was noted in the context of changes in the broader political and corporate landscape regarding DEI terminology.103
Despite these changes in public presentation, Eversource stated that its "commitment to fostering an engaged, respectful and supportive workplace remains the same." The company confirmed that its internal "inclusion council" and seven "business resource groups" (supporting minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, etc.) remain active and play a key role in shaping organizational culture.75 This suggests that while the external messaging may have been modified, internal structures supporting diversity and inclusion persist. Engagement with Eversource should be sensitive to this evolving public posture, focusing on inclusive practices rather than specific "DEI" labels unless initiated by the company.
Environmental and Sustainability Commitments:
Environmental stewardship and sustainability are central to Eversource's corporate identity and strategy. The company has a prominent goal to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2030 57 and reported a 30% reduction in its operational GHG emissions between 2018 and 2023.57 Key initiatives include improving energy efficiency at its facilities, transitioning its fleet to hybrid and electric vehicles, and actively working to reduce methane emissions from its gas operations.57 Eversource has received numerous national awards for its sustainability efforts and climate leadership, reinforcing this commitment.5
Corporate Communications Style:
Eversource's external communications are generally professional, customer-centric, and emphasize themes of reliability, safety, community partnership, and sustainability leadership. As noted, there has been a recent adjustment in the public communication surrounding D&I initiatives.
Employee Review Themes (e.g., from Comparably, Glassdoor references):
Overall Culture: Employee reviews on platforms like Comparably rate Eversource's overall culture as average to good (C+ or Top 50% of similar-sized companies).105
Positives: Employees express high satisfaction with compensation, perks, and benefits.105 Many report a positive onboarding experience and find their direct managers helpful.106 A sense of happiness at work and effective meetings are also noted by a majority of respondents on Comparably.106 Employee testimonials in job postings highlight a culture that "puts its customers and employees first" and offers good work-life balance.75 The company is recognized as a "Best Place to Work" by some regional bodies, citing positive corporate culture, work-life balance, green practices, diversity and inclusion, and employee growth opportunities.97
Areas for Improvement (Constructive Feedback): About 30% of reviews on Comparably offer constructive feedback.106 The quality of coworkers received a C- grade from participants on that platform.106 Specific "cons" are not detailed in the provided snippets beyond these aggregated scores. Job postings often link to the company's Glassdoor profile for more reviews.107
Leadership Communication Patterns from Public Sources:
CEO Joe Nolan and other executives frequently communicate through earnings calls, press releases, and investor presentations. Their messaging consistently reinforces the strategic priorities of focusing on the core regulated utility business, investing in reliability and clean energy, ensuring customer affordability, and strengthening the company's financial position.8
Recognition and Awards for Corporate Culture:
Eversource has received awards such as "Best Place to Work" from the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut (2023) 97, recognition as one of the "Healthiest 100 Workplaces in America" (2023) 96, and the VETS Indexes awards for supporting veterans.5 These awards suggest external validation of positive aspects of its workplace culture and employee support programs.
The cultural emphasis on reliability, safety, and customer service, combined with a strategic focus on modernization and sustainability, provides clear alignment points for NCC Group. Messaging that underscores how robust cybersecurity underpins these core values and strategic objectives is likely to be well-received. The company's performance-oriented culture 96 suggests an appreciation for solutions that deliver measurable results and contribute to achieving business goals.
