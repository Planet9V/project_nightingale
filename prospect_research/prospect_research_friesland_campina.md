1. Organization Profile & Leadership
1.1 Company Overview: Heritage, Structure, and Global Reach
Friesland Campina, officially known as Royal FrieslandCampina N.V. 1, is headquartered in Amersfoort, Netherlands.2 The company's origins trace back over 150 years to 1871, when Dutch farmers collaboratively established cheese-making factories to strengthen their market position and ensure milk sales.1 This cooperative spirit culminated in the formation of Royal FrieslandCampina N.V. on December 30, 2008, through the merger of Friesland Foods and Campina.9
The company's unique structure is defined by its ownership: it is wholly owned by Zuivelcoöperatie FrieslandCampina U.A., which comprises 14,183 member dairy farmers in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.1 These farmers are not merely suppliers but are the joint owners and supervisors of the company, ensuring that their interests are paramount in its operations and strategic direction.3 This cooperative model fundamentally shapes Friesland Campina’s strategic decisions and long-term vision. The company’s core ambition is to "optimally valorise the milk of our member dairy farmers to enable us to pay them a leading milk price".1 This primary focus on the long-term livelihood of its farmer-owners, coupled with a commitment to sustainable practices and stability, can lead to different risk appetites and investment priorities compared to purely profit-driven corporations. For instance, investments in foundational security that protect the entire value chain, from farm to consumer, are likely to be highly valued as they contribute directly to the stability and trust essential for the cooperative's continued success.
Friesland Campina boasts an extensive global footprint, maintaining offices in 36 countries and distributing its products in over 100 countries worldwide.6 Within the Netherlands, its operational presence is substantial, with 26 locations, including its corporate headquarters, numerous production sites (e.g., Balkbrug, Veghel, Workum), and a pivotal Innovation Centre in Wageningen.16 Beyond its home country, Friesland Campina has a significant presence across Europe, Africa, Asia, and North/South America, with various offices and production facilities.7 This broad geographic diversification across both developed and emerging markets is viewed as a positive factor, offering strong long-term growth potential despite potential profit volatility in certain regions.19 The extensive and diverse global presence inherently creates a complex and distributed IT environment. This complexity significantly expands the potential attack surface and presents considerable cybersecurity challenges, necessitating robust and regionally adaptable security solutions. Such solutions are vital for maintaining business continuity, protecting diverse data sets collected across different markets, and ensuring compliance with varied regulatory landscapes worldwide.
The company's operations are structured around seven distinct business groups: Europe, Retail & Americas, Middle East, Pakistan & Africa (MEPA), Asia, Ingredients, Professional & Trading, and Specialised Nutrition.1 This diversified structure allows Friesland Campina to focus on specific customers, products, brands, and markets, effectively spreading risks and capitalizing on diverse opportunities across its portfolio.1 The company’s brand portfolio includes well-known names such as Friso International, Frisian Flag Indonesia, Debic International, Dutch Lady Asia, Campina, Peak Nigeria, Rainbow Middle East, Alaska Philippines, and Foremost Thailand.1 The distinct focus of each business group implies that their IT and security needs may vary considerably. A uniform security approach might prove inefficient or inadequate. This suggests an opportunity to tailor security offerings to the specific operational contexts, digital maturity levels, and unique risk profiles of individual business groups. For instance, the Ingredients and Specialised Nutrition segments achieved particularly strong operating profits in 2024 20, indicating these are high-growth, high-value areas that may have more advanced digital initiatives and, consequently, more complex security requirements.
Friesland Campina has a dynamic history marked by continuous mergers, acquisitions, and divestments. The 2008 merger that formed the current entity was a significant event, requiring divestments to satisfy EU approval conditions.9 Prior to this, Campina had acquired numerous entities, including Comelco NV (Belgium, 1989), Deltown Specialities (US, 1989), Menken (Netherlands, 1997), Parmalat Thailand (2003), Napolact (Romania, 2004), Innovatech Argentina (2005), and several German dairies.9 Post-merger, notable acquisitions included Alaska Milk Corporation (Philippines, 2012), Engro Foods Limited (Pakistan, 2016), and Friso (Philippines, 2016).9 Recent divestments include the sale of its Russian subsidiary Campina LLC in 2021 22 and parts of its German consumer dairy business, including the "Landliebe" and "Tuffi" brands, to Theo Müller Group.23 The company continues this trend of industry consolidation, with plans to merge with Milcobel in December 2024.2 This extensive and ongoing M&A activity points to a highly dynamic organizational structure and a heterogeneous IT infrastructure. Each transaction, whether an acquisition or divestment, involves integrating or separating IT systems, networks, and data, processes that are inherently complex and often introduce security gaps. The planned merger with Milcobel represents an immediate, high-value opportunity for specialized cybersecurity services, such as pre-merger security assessments, secure integration planning, and post-merger security audits, demonstrating a recurring need for such expertise within Friesland Campina.
1.2 Strategic Direction: Mission, Values, and Ambition
Friesland Campina’s strategic direction is deeply rooted in its core purpose, "Nourishing by Nature".1 This purpose encompasses a commitment to providing better nutrition globally, ensuring a sustainable livelihood for its farmers across generations, and generating a positive impact on both people and the planet.15 This guiding principle informs all of the company's strategic choices.1 The corporate culture is underpinned by three core values: "We act with respect," "We aim higher," and "We succeed together".15 These values emphasize collaboration, continuous improvement, integrity, responsibility, and a collective pursuit of success.15 The company's ambition is to optimize the value derived from its member dairy farmers' milk, ensuring they receive a leading milk price. This objective drives the production of high-quality dairy products, generating maximum value that enables farmers to invest in the long-term sustainability of their farms.1 This purpose-driven and value-based approach signals a company that prioritizes long-term partnerships, shared goals, and ethical conduct. Security solutions should therefore be framed not merely as technical necessities but as integral contributions to Friesland Campina's core purpose and values, demonstrating how robust security enables their mission (e.g., protecting food safety, ensuring supply chain integrity for farmer livelihoods, safeguarding data for sustainable practices) and fosters collaborative success.
The company’s strategy is further articulated through its "Doing DAIRY Right" framework, which comprises five key pillars 15:
Diverse business as our strength: This pillar highlights the strategic advantage of operating across seven distinct business groups, each focused on specific markets and products. This diversification allows Friesland Campina to capitalize on varied opportunities and effectively mitigate risks across its portfolio.11
Accessible nutrition & great taste: This addresses the growing global demand for high-quality, nutritional, and affordable food, with Friesland Campina aiming to lead in product quality and flavor within its operational markets.1
In balance with the planet: This pillar underscores a deep commitment to sustainability, focusing on reducing environmental impact, achieving net-positive contributions to nature, and fostering sustainable production processes throughout its value chain.15
Results driven: This emphasizes improving profitability and stimulating sustainable growth to ensure a good living for its member dairy farmers.15
You make it possible: This pillar stresses the importance of collaboration, combining forces, and sharing knowledge across the dairy sector, including with farmers, suppliers, customers, NGOs, scientific organizations, and governments.15
These "Doing DAIRY Right" pillars offer direct avenues for aligning security services with Friesland Campina's overarching strategy. For instance, "In balance with the planet" is highly relevant, as cybersecurity can be positioned as a crucial enabler for sustainable operations, such as securing IoT devices in smart farming, protecting energy management systems for CO2 reduction targets, and ensuring the integrity of data used for environmental reporting. Similarly, "Results driven" directly links to operational efficiency and profitability, where robust cybersecurity contributes by mitigating costly breaches and operational disruptions. The "You make it possible" pillar explicitly signals an openness to external partnerships and knowledge sharing, creating a clear invitation for engagement as a collaborative expert.
A significant recent strategic initiative is "Expedition 2030," a major transformation program launched in the second half of 2023.26 This initiative is designed to reshape Friesland Campina into a leading dairy company 26, with a focus on specific product and market combinations across its business groups.27 The program's core objectives are to "win in the market, expand our margin, and generate cash".27 As part of "Expedition 2030," Friesland Campina aims for substantial cost savings, targeting €400-€500 million from 2026, with significant savings already realized in 2024.21 This includes a reduction of nearly 1,400 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in 2024 compared to 2023 20, and €315 million in cost savings achieved through "Expedition 2030" and "Performance+" programs, with €222 million originating from supply chain improvements.20 Furthermore, the company plans to invest approximately €500-€550 million in capital expenditure (capex) in 2024 and 2025 to boost production capacity for specialized nutrition ingredients and to support efficiency and sustainability projects.21 This major, ongoing transformation program, with its clear financial and operational objectives, presents a significant opportunity. Security solutions can be positioned as critical enablers for achieving these goals by enhancing operational resilience, streamlining processes, mitigating risks associated with new digital initiatives (e.g., cloud adoption, automation), and protecting intellectual property related to new product development. The workforce reductions also imply a leaner organization, increasing reliance on efficient and secure digital processes.
1.3 Financial Performance & Trajectory
Friesland Campina's financial performance has shown a notable trajectory over the past three years.

In 2022, Friesland Campina reported strong growth, with revenue increasing by 22.4% to €14.1 billion, operating profit rising by 32.7% to €471 million, and net result growing by 69.8% to €292 million.28 However, 2023 proved challenging, with revenue decreasing by 7% to €13.072 billion, operating profit dropping significantly to €75 million, and the company recording a net loss of €149 million.1 The financial landscape shifted positively in 2024, as the company achieved a significant improvement in operating profit, reaching €527 million, and returned to a net profit of €321 million.1 Revenue in 2024 slightly decreased by 1.1% to €12.9 billion due to unfavorable currency translation effects, but on a constant currency basis, revenue increased by 1.3%.1 The company also generated a positive operating cash flow of €900 million in 2024, an increase from €831 million in 2023.20 The sharp rebound in operating profit and net result in 2024, following a difficult 2023, indicates a successful initial phase of the "Expedition 2030" transformation and a renewed financial health. This positive trajectory suggests Friesland Campina is in a stronger position to invest in strategic areas like digital transformation and advanced cybersecurity solutions that support its growth and efficiency objectives, rather than being solely focused on reactive cost-cutting. The improved cash flow also signifies greater liquidity for such investments.
The company faced difficult market conditions in 2023, including lower consumer demand for dairy products as consumers sought more affordable private-label alternatives amidst high inflation and reduced purchasing power.21 Unfavorable foreign exchange movements also contributed to the revenue decline.21 Additionally, Friesland Campina incurred significant one-off restructuring costs totaling €260 million related to facility closures and organizational restructuring in 2022.31 In response to these challenges and as part of "Expedition 2030," the company achieved €315 million in cost savings in 2024, with €222 million specifically from supply chain improvements.20 These savings were partly used to offset inflation effects.20 Looking ahead, Friesland Campina anticipates further cost reductions of €100-€150 million in 2025, which will be utilized to offset inflation, facilitate growth, and support profitability.30 Investments are expected to be somewhat lower in 2025 due to the completion of large projects in 2024.30 The company also processed 3.2% less milk in the first half of 2024, partly due to the "Exit Scheme" that allowed member dairy farmers to leave the cooperative, a condition of the EU merger approval that concluded in November 2023.27 The persistent focus on cost savings and efficiency, particularly within the supply chain, directly aligns with the potential for security solutions in operational technology (OT) and supply chain risk management. Securing these critical areas can prevent costly disruptions, improve operational uptime, and directly contribute to the targeted savings. The impact of currency fluctuations and inflation underscores the need for robust financial and operational resilience, which a strong cybersecurity posture underpins by preventing financial losses from breaches or operational downtime. The decline in milk supply also emphasizes the importance of optimizing existing assets and ensuring their secure and efficient operation.

The recent appointment of Kemal Cetin as Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer in March 2025 39 represents a significant strategic development. This role, previously held by Cetin as Global Chief Information Officer and Chief Transformation Officer 39, signifies a strong, renewed strategic emphasis on digital transformation and its direct linkage to core business outcomes. This indicates a top-level mandate for technology-driven initiatives, where cybersecurity is not merely an afterthought but is recognized as a foundational enabler. Furthermore, the CISO, Carlo Alexander Schreurs, advocates for a progressive "adaptive trust" security model and emphasizes human-centered cybersecurity, cultural shifts, and integrating cybersecurity with business goals to drive innovation beyond mere compliance.40 This forward-thinking perspective suggests an openness to innovative, holistic security solutions that support business agility and innovation, implying a receptive audience for strategic security partnerships.
Friesland Campina's governance structure is deeply intertwined with its cooperative roots. Royal FrieslandCampina N.V. is wholly owned by Zuivelcoöperatie FrieslandCampina U.A..3 The cooperative's operations are geographically segmented into 14 districts, each with a District Board. The 140 members of these District Boards collectively form the Cooperative's Members' Council.13 This Members' Council is responsible for appointing the nine members of the Board of the Cooperative 13, which then acts as the General Meeting of Shareholders for the company, exercising all shareholder rights.54
The Supervisory Board plays a critical oversight role, supervising the Executive Board's policies and the overall course of the company. It also advises the Executive Board on strategy, major risks, and the effectiveness of risk management and control systems.32 A distinctive feature of this board is that five of its nine members are active member dairy farmers 56, ensuring that farmer interests are directly represented at the highest level of governance. The Supervisory Board also includes an Audit and Risk Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the audit plan with external auditors.56 This unique cooperative ownership and multi-layered governance structure, with significant farmer representation, means that major decisions are likely evaluated not only on immediate financial returns but also on their broader impact on farmers' livelihoods, long-term stability, and the cooperative's sustainability. This reinforces the need for security proposals to emphasize how robust cybersecurity provides stability, resilience, and protects the entire "grass to glass" value chain, ensuring milk quality and maintaining farmer trust, which are paramount to their core identity.
The decision-making process for significant investments is multi-layered. The Executive Board holds collective responsibility for overall management, including compliance, risk management, and financing.32 They regularly discuss internal risk management and control systems with the Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee.32 Crucially, the company's General Meeting of Shareholders (comprising the Board of the Cooperative) has the authority to approve certain Executive Board decisions as outlined in the articles of association.54 For a number of major shareholder decisions, the Board of the Cooperative requires prior approval from the Cooperative's Members' Council.54 Friesland Campina also maintains strict rules to prevent conflicts of interest, requiring Supervisory Board approval for material transactions involving conflicting interests.54 For technology procurement, the company utilizes formal e-procurement platforms such as SAP Ariba and Coupa Supplier Portal for sourcing events, including RFQs and auctions.57 Suppliers receive email invitations and submit bids through these structured digital channels.57 The Procurement team aims to function as "strategic business partners," developing sourcing strategies based on market trends and focusing on "value-creating sourcing solutions" that encompass savings, innovation, sustainability, and cash generation.58 This multi-layered approval process indicates a potentially slower, more consensus-driven decision-making process, particularly for significant investments. Engagement must involve multiple stakeholders early in the sales cycle, building a strong, well-documented business case that addresses both strategic and operational benefits, aligning with the cooperative's long-term vision, farmer interests, and the specific mandates of key executives (e.g., Digital Solutions, Supply Chain, Sustainability). The formal use of SAP Ariba and Coupa for procurement means that engagement must be prepared to navigate structured digital procurement channels, emphasizing value and strategic partnership as outlined by their procurement philosophy.
1.5 Corporate Culture, ESG, and Reputation
Friesland Campina's corporate culture is deeply rooted in the belief that every employee contributes to the company's results and the realization of its "Nourishing by Nature" purpose.25 A central tenet is the "Power of We," which underscores that collaboration is fundamental to their cooperative identity. This fosters partnerships built on trust and respect, driven by the diversity of their workforce, individual enthusiasm, and collective commitment.15 The company encourages employees to "Unleash your Nature," promoting authenticity, creativity, and innovative approaches to work. This is described as an inclusive, open, and pragmatic culture founded on trust and respect.24 The core values of "We act with respect," "We aim higher," and "We succeed together" further reinforce this collaborative and growth-oriented mindset.15 This strong emphasis on collaboration, trust, and collective success suggests that a highly collaborative, partnership-oriented sales approach will resonate deeply with Friesland Campina's cultural fabric. Demonstrating how security solutions foster teamwork, shared responsibility in security, and contribute to collective resilience will be particularly impactful.
Friesland Campina is committed to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), with a strategy focused on building a diverse workforce, fostering an inclusive environment where individuals feel they belong and have equal opportunities, and growing together to reflect every individual’s best self in their culture.59 They have set specific targets for 2030, including achieving at least one-third women and one-third men on the Supervisory Board, and at least 30% representation for both genders on the Executive Board and Executive Team.59 For senior management, the target is 50% women and 50% men, with at least 50% representation from different nationalities.59 The company also supports mental and physical well-being and the LGBTIQ+ community, while respecting local cultures and legislation.60 This commitment to DE&I indicates a progressive, socially conscious organization that values diverse perspectives and ethical practices.
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) responsibility is a core pillar of Friesland Campina's strategy, viewed as both a "license to operate" and a driver of value creation.15 Their "Nourishing a better planet" program includes ambitious sustainability commitments. They aim to achieve net climate-neutral dairy production by 2050, with significant CO2 emission reductions targeted by 2030 (33% reduction on farms, 40% from production facilities/tankers from 2015 levels).61 In 2024, they achieved a 4.1% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) compared to 2023, with a 9.8% reduction from member milk (Scope 3).62 Their sustainability efforts also include regenerative agriculture pilots, optimizing resource use, reducing manure emissions, generating green energy, and cutting water consumption.28 They emphasize transparent sourcing, with 100% of agricultural raw materials sourced sustainably and a target of 92% traceability by 2025.61 This deep commitment to ESG and sustainability offers a strong alignment point for security solutions. Cybersecurity can be positioned as a critical enabler for these environmental goals, such as securing IoT devices in smart farming, protecting energy management systems for CO2 reduction targets, and ensuring the integrity of data used for environmental reporting.
Friesland Campina maintains a strong corporate reputation and has received significant recognition for its corporate culture and sustainability efforts. In 2023, the company ranked third among Dutch companies with the best reputation, making it the highest-ranked food company, surpassing Heineken and Unilever.63 This reflects the collective efforts of its 15,000 member dairy farmers and nearly 22,000 employees.63 The company also holds impressive rankings in the Food and Agriculture Benchmark, placing 22nd out of 350 companies overall, 3rd among animal protein producers, and 18th among food and beverage manufacturers/processors.6 It ranks particularly high in governance and strategy (6th) and nutrition (7th).6 Friesland Campina was honored with the EuroCham Sustainability Award 2024 in the "Sustainovation Value Chain" category for its innovation in creating a sustainable value chain across Asia.64 Friesland Campina China received the "Pioneer in Advancing Rural Revitalization Award" for its "Loving Yuesao" CSR project 65, and Friesland Campina Asia won the Asian CSR Award in 2016 for its Dairy Development Programme.66 This strong reputation and numerous awards, particularly in sustainability and governance, indicate a company that values external validation and public perception. A robust security posture, especially with a reputable partner, can be leveraged as a positive reputational asset, showcasing their commitment to robust security and responsible operations, thereby protecting brand trust and consumer confidence.
2. Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture
2.1 Core Technology Landscape
Friesland Campina utilizes a diverse array of core technology systems and platforms to support its extensive global operations. Key systems identified include iCIMS for applicant tracking, SAP GRC for governance, risk, and compliance, and Gartner for intelligence and analytics.5 For general office productivity, Microsoft Word is used, while Digital Insight supports online banking functionalities. Programming is supported by C++, and web analytics are handled by Google Analytics, with SiteManager used for web design and development services.5 The presence of SAP GRC indicates a formal approach to governance, risk, and compliance, suggesting an existing framework for managing security risks. However, the diverse technology stack and reliance on a major IT services partner implies a complex, potentially fragmented environment that requires comprehensive security oversight beyond what a single vendor might provide. This creates an opening for specialized, independent security assessments and advisory services.
For its procurement processes, Friesland Campina actively uses SAP Ariba and Coupa Supplier Portal for sourcing events, including Requests for Quotation (RFQs) and auctions.57 These platforms streamline supplier engagement and manage transaction volumes.57
A significant development in Friesland Campina's IT operations is its strategic partnership with Wipro. In a five-and-a-half-year engagement announced in January 2025, Wipro was selected to manage Friesland Campina's Core IT Services, encompassing end-to-end Service Management, Infrastructure & Cybersecurity Services, and Enterprise Application Management Services.4 This partnership aims to support Friesland Campina's strategic objectives of enhancing profitability and sustainable growth through IT services designed to improve business outcomes and drive innovation.67 The long-term, comprehensive partnership with Wipro for IT and cybersecurity services indicates a strategic decision to outsource significant portions of their IT operations. While Wipro covers many areas, this creates a need for independent assurance and specialized expertise that a large outsourcer might not provide (e.g., niche penetration testing, advanced threat modeling, security architecture review of Wipro's services). This allows for positioning an independent third-party validator and specialized security partner, ensuring that the outsourced services meet Friesland Campina's evolving security posture and business needs.
Friesland Campina places a strong emphasis on digital transformation and solutions as a core enabler of its future strategy. This is underscored by the appointment of Kemal Cetin as Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer in March 2025.4 This role is specifically tasked with leading digital and business solutions initiatives, driving innovation, and achieving operational excellence across the organization.39 The company's digital transformation agenda spans several major programs 68, with a focus on leveraging digital insights and solutions to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences.4 The "Expedition 2030" transformation program also includes overarching digital transformation initiatives.67 Friesland Campina's explicit emphasis on digital transformation and the creation of a dedicated C-level role for it signifies that technology is a core enabler of their future strategy. This presents a high-value opportunity for NCC Group to position itself as a critical partner in securing these transformation efforts, particularly in areas like cloud adoption, data analytics, and automation, which are often central to digital transformation.

2.2 IT and Security Leadership
Friesland Campina's IT and security leadership team reflects a strategic and evolving approach to technology and risk management.
Kemal Cetin serves as the Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer, a role he assumed in March 2025.39 His extensive background includes over seven years at Friesland Campina, where he held key leadership roles such as Chief Transformation Officer and Global Chief Information Officer.39 Prior to joining Friesland Campina, Cetin gained significant experience in digital transformation, business strategy, and IT leadership at prominent firms like Bain & Company, Diageo, Coca-Cola Enterprises, Whirlpool Corporation, Colgate-Palmolive, and T-Systems Turkey.39 His appointment to this newly created C-level position underscores the organization's commitment to driving innovation and operational excellence through digital initiatives.
Carlo Alexander Schreurs holds the critical role of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).40 Schreurs is recognized for his progressive views on cybersecurity, advocating for a shift from rigid "zero trust" models to a more flexible "adaptive trust" framework, which he believes is better suited for the demands of digital transformation.40 His philosophy emphasizes cultural shifts within cybersecurity, promoting storytelling, collaboration, and psychological safety to build trust and resilience across the organization.40 Schreurs also stresses the importance of integrating cybersecurity with broader business goals, moving beyond mere compliance to actively drive innovation.40 He has contributed to public discourse through articles on human-centric transformations in cybersecurity.40 The CISO's progressive "adaptive trust" philosophy and the Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer's background, who was previously Global CIO, suggest a sophisticated and evolving understanding of cybersecurity. These leaders are likely seeking advanced, integrated security solutions that support business agility and innovation, rather than just basic compliance. This indicates an opportunity for high-level strategic discussions about future-proofing their digital landscape.
Holger Janßen is the Global Director Enterprise Technology Services.67 He has publicly stated that the strategic partnership with Wipro is "a pivotal element to achieve our long-term vision," emphasizing the role of Wipro's expertise in elevating efficiency and accelerating innovation within Friesland Campina's IT landscape.67 His statements highlight the importance of external partnerships in achieving strategic IT objectives.
Maria Umar Memon serves as the Head of Internal Audit at Friesland Campina Engro Pakistan Limited.69 She brings extensive expertise in internal controls evaluation, risk management, and corporate governance, with a proven track record in transforming internal audit functions across diverse industries.69 Memon has implemented AI-driven audit analytics and digital risk monitoring to optimize processes and enhance decision-making, and she oversees the "Speak Up" process locally.69 Her role and use of AI-driven analytics indicate a data-driven approach to risk management, which can be addressed with metrics-based security reporting.
A former key figure in the technology leadership was Margrethe Jonkman, who served as Global Director Research & Development (CTO) from 2018 to 2023.70
The presence of a CISO with a progressive security philosophy and a Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer with a strong digital transformation mandate indicates that Friesland Campina's leadership is looking beyond traditional IT. They are interested in how technology and security can enable business growth and efficiency. This provides a crucial signal to tailor offerings to align with these forward-thinking perspectives, demonstrating how security can be an enabler for innovation and business resilience, not just a cost center. Maria Memon's role further suggests a need for measurable security outcomes and a data-driven approach to risk.
2.3 Cybersecurity Focus and Initiatives
Friesland Campina explicitly links "quality, safety, and cybersecurity" as a key area of focus, as highlighted in its 2022 annual report.31 This indicates that cybersecurity is recognized as an integral component of its operational integrity and overall risk management framework. The Executive Board is directly responsible for ensuring compliance with legislation and regulations and for managing company risks, and they regularly discuss internal risk management and control systems with the Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee.32 This high-level oversight underscores the strategic importance of cybersecurity within the organization.
The CISO, Carlo Alexander Schreurs, further articulates a mature security mindset by advocating for an "adaptive trust" model and emphasizing the need to move beyond mere compliance to drive innovation.40 This approach suggests a desire for flexible, intelligent security solutions that can adapt to a dynamic business environment and support agility. This opens the door for advanced, proactive security services, such as threat intelligence, offensive security, and security architecture review, that help them build resilience and drive innovation, rather than just meeting minimum requirements. The explicit mention of "cybersecurity" as a key area and the CISO's stated philosophy demonstrate that cybersecurity is a recognized and evolving priority. The shift from "zero trust" to "adaptive trust" implies a need for flexible, intelligent security solutions that can provide continuous assurance and enable secure innovation.
In a significant move to enhance its IT operations and cybersecurity posture, Friesland Campina selected Wipro as a strategic partner for a five-and-a-half-year engagement, announced in January 2025.4 This partnership entails Wipro managing Friesland Campina's Core IT Services, including end-to-end Service Management, Infrastructure & Cybersecurity Services, and Enterprise Application Management Services.4 Wipro's mandate is to support Friesland Campina's strategic objectives of enhancing profitability and sustainable growth through IT services designed to improve business outcomes and drive innovation.67 The long-term, comprehensive nature of this outsourcing agreement for IT and cybersecurity services indicates a strategic decision to entrust significant portions of these operations to a third party. While Wipro covers many areas, this reliance on an outsourcer inherently creates a need for independent assurance and specialized expertise that a large outsourcer might not provide in niche areas (e.g., highly specialized penetration testing, advanced threat modeling, or independent security architecture review of Wipro's managed services). This situation presents an opportunity to position NCC Group as an independent third-party validator and specialized security partner, ensuring that the outsourced services consistently meet Friesland Campina's evolving security posture and specific business needs.
2.4 Technology Procurement Processes
Friesland Campina employs formal e-procurement platforms for its technology acquisitions and supplier engagements. The company utilizes SAP Ariba and Coupa Supplier Portal for various sourcing events, including Requests for Quotation (RFQs) and auctions.57 Suppliers are invited to participate via email and are required to log into or create an account on these platforms to view event details, submit bids, and manage interactions.57 This structured approach means that any engagement must be prepared to navigate formal digital channels, adhering to specified bidding processes and deadlines.
The company's approach to supplier engagement extends beyond mere transactional efficiency. Friesland Campina's Procurement team aims to be "strategic business partners".58 They develop sourcing strategies based on thorough understanding of market trends and developments, with the goal of creating "value-creating sourcing solutions" that encompass savings, innovation, sustainability, and cash generation.58 This philosophy emphasizes "unleashing the power of our suppliers to deliver sustainable value".58 Furthermore, Friesland Campina believes in combining forces and sharing knowledge with its suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders.15 This procurement philosophy signals that Friesland Campina values partners who can offer more than just cost savings. It aligns perfectly with the ability to offer value-added security services that contribute to innovation (e.g., secure digital transformation), sustainability (e.g., secure smart agriculture initiatives), and financial stability (e.g., preventing costly breaches and operational downtime). Therefore, emphasis should be placed on these broader value propositions in any engagement, demonstrating how security contributes to their strategic procurement goals, particularly innovation and sustainability, which are core to Friesland Campina's overall strategy.
3. Strategic Sales Approach & Battle Card for NCC Group
3.1 Friesland Campina's Strategic Needs & Pain Points
Friesland Campina's complex organizational structure, dynamic financial landscape, and evolving technical environment present a unique set of strategic needs and potential pain points that NCC Group can address.
Challenges:
Managing a Complex, Distributed, and Potentially Heterogeneous IT Infrastructure: Friesland Campina's extensive global footprint across 36 countries, numerous production facilities, and a history of mergers and acquisitions has likely resulted in a diverse and potentially fragmented IT environment.6 This complexity increases the attack surface and complicates unified security management.
Maintaining Security Posture Across Diverse Business Units: With seven distinct business groups, each focusing on specific markets and products, there are likely varied IT and security needs, requiring tailored approaches rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.11
Navigating Volatile Market Conditions and Ensuring Operational Resilience: Despite a strong rebound in 2024, the company has faced challenges from currency effects, inflation, and fluctuating milk prices.20 This necessitates robust operational resilience to prevent disruptions that could impact financial results.
Securing Ongoing Digital Transformation and Cost-Saving Initiatives: The "Expedition 2030" program involves significant digital transformation and aims for substantial cost savings.4 Securing these initiatives is crucial to realizing their full benefits and preventing new vulnerabilities.
Protecting Critical Operational Technology (OT) and Data Related to Sustainable Farming and Production: As a food manufacturing company (NAICS 311) with extensive production facilities and a focus on regenerative agriculture and climate goals, Friesland Campina relies heavily on OT and industrial control systems.4 Securing these environments is paramount to operational continuity and data integrity.
Ensuring Independent Assurance Over Outsourced IT and Cybersecurity Services: The comprehensive, long-term partnership with Wipro for core IT and cybersecurity services 4 creates a need for independent oversight and validation to ensure that outsourced services meet Friesland Campina's specific security requirements and risk appetite.
Opportunities:
Strong Financial Rebound in 2024: The significant improvement in operating profit and net result in 2024 indicates a healthy financial position and capacity for strategic investments in security.20
Leadership's Explicit Focus on Digital Transformation and Innovation: The appointment of Kemal Cetin as Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer highlights a top-level mandate for technology-driven initiatives.39
Progressive CISO Open to "Adaptive Trust" and Human-Centered Security: Carlo Alexander Schreurs' philosophy suggests an openness to innovative, holistic security solutions that support business agility and innovation.40
Deep Commitment to ESG and Sustainability: Friesland Campina's "Nourishing by Nature" purpose and "In balance with the planet" pillar offer a strong alignment point for security solutions that protect environmental data, smart farming systems, and supply chain integrity.15
Cooperative Model Values Long-Term Partnerships and Shared Success: The company's "Power of We" culture and focus on farmer livelihood align with a collaborative, long-term partnership approach.8
Procurement Views Suppliers as Strategic Partners for Value Creation: The procurement team seeks "value-creating sourcing solutions" that include innovation and sustainability, not just cost savings.58
The blend of traditional IT security needs (ERP, web analytics) with emerging OT security requirements (production facilities, smart farming) and M&A-driven complexity creates a highly diversified security challenge. NCC Group's comprehensive portfolio, especially its deep expertise in OT and supply chain security, provides a unique value proposition that directly addresses Friesland Campina's specific vulnerabilities and strategic growth areas.

3.2 Key Stakeholder Engagement Strategy
To effectively engage Friesland Campina, NCC Group must identify and tailor its messaging to resonate with primary decision-makers and key influencers across the organization.
Primary Decision-Makers/Budget Holders:
Jan Derck van Karnebeek (CEO): As the ultimate decision-maker, his focus is on overall strategy, profitability, and the company's purpose.32 Messaging should emphasize how robust security contributes to financial resilience, enables profitable growth, and protects the long-term value for the cooperative and its farmer-owners.
Hans Janssen (CFO): Concerned with financial implications, cost savings, and long-term value creation.32 Proposals should highlight how security investments reduce financial risk (e.g., breach costs, regulatory fines), contribute to operational efficiency, and support sustainable financial performance.
Kemal Cetin (Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer): His mandate revolves around digital transformation, innovation, and operational excellence, including IT strategy.39 Engagement should focus on how security can securely enable digital transformation initiatives, protect new business models, and ensure the resilience of digital operations.
David Cutter (Chief Supply Chain and R&D Officer): Responsible for supply chain effectiveness, technology, process simplification, and sustainability within the supply chain.32 Messaging should highlight supply chain resilience, OT security, and how security contributes to production efficiency and sustainability across the "grass to glass" value chain.
Carlo Alexander Schreurs (CISO): Leads cybersecurity strategy and risk management, with a progressive view on "adaptive trust" and human-centered security.40 Discussions should revolve around advanced threat protection, adaptive security models, integrating the human element in security, and strategic partnerships for innovation.
Key Influencers/Stakeholders:
Mireille Einwachter (Chief Sustainability Officer): Focuses on ESG alignment, climate goals, and regenerative agriculture.33 Security can be framed as an enabler for sustainability initiatives, such as protecting climate data, securing smart farm systems, and ensuring the integrity of environmental reporting.
Maria Umar Memon (Head of Internal Audit, Friesland Campina Engro Pakistan Limited): Her expertise lies in internal controls, risk management, and audit technology.69 Engagement should focus on how security solutions enhance compliance, improve risk visibility, and leverage technology for more effective audit and control processes.
Holger Janßen (Global Director Enterprise Technology Services): Oversees IT operations, efficiency, and innovation.67 Discussions can center on how independent security services complement existing IT operations and enhance overall efficiency and innovation.
Presidents of Business Groups (Europe, Asia, Ingredients, etc.): These leaders manage specific business needs and market opportunities.11 Tailoring security value propositions to their specific market challenges and demonstrating how security supports their unique business goals will be important.
Supervisory Board / Members' Council: These bodies oversee long-term value creation, farmer interests, and cooperative stability.13 Messaging should emphasize how robust security protects brand reputation, ensures long-term stability, and safeguards farmer interests and milk quality.
This diverse leadership team necessitates a multi-faceted engagement strategy. NCC Group cannot rely on a single point of contact. Understanding each leader's specific mandate (e.g., Cetin for digital, Cutter for supply chain, Einwachter for sustainability) is crucial for tailoring a compelling value proposition that speaks directly to their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and strategic objectives.
3.3 Navigating the Sales Cycle
Navigating Friesland Campina's sales cycle requires a strategic and patient approach, leveraging insights into their formal procurement processes and multi-layered decision-making structure.
Leveraging insights into Friesland Campina's procurement processes and decision-making structure:
Formal Procurement: NCC Group must be prepared for structured RFQ and auction processes conducted via SAP Ariba and Coupa Supplier Portal.57 All documentation must be complete, accurate, and submitted by established deadlines. Adherence to these formal channels is non-negotiable.
Strategic Sourcing: Friesland Campina's procurement team views suppliers as "strategic business partners" who deliver "value-creating sourcing solutions" beyond mere cost, encompassing innovation, sustainability, and cash generation.58 NCC Group should position itself as such a partner, articulating how its security services contribute to these broader strategic goals.
Multi-Stakeholder Engagement: Given the multi-layered approval process involving the Executive Board, Supervisory Board, and the Members' Council 54, NCC Group needs to engage with key leaders across IT, Supply Chain, Digital Solutions, Sustainability, and Finance early in the sales cycle. Building consensus and demonstrating value across different functional areas is critical for success.
Long-Term Vision: Proposals should be framed in terms of long-term value creation and resilience, aligning with Friesland Campina's cooperative nature and its "Expedition 2030" goals.26 This resonates with their inherent focus on generational sustainability for member farmers.
Risk Management Alignment: It is important to emphasize how NCC Group's services contribute to effective risk management and control systems, which are regularly reviewed by the Executive and Supervisory Boards.32 This demonstrates an understanding of their governance priorities.
Given the complex decision-making and strategic procurement approach, NCC Group should prioritize building long-term, consultative relationships rather than transactional sales. Focusing on pilots and demonstrating tangible value aligned with their strategic pillars will be key to gaining traction and navigating their multi-layered approval process.
Recommendations for initial engagement and building long-term partnerships:
Initial Outreach: Initiate discussions with Kemal Cetin (Chief Business & Digital Solutions Officer) and Carlo Alexander Schreurs (CISO). These individuals represent the nexus of digital strategy and cybersecurity, making them ideal entry points for strategic conversations.
Value-Driven Conversations: Shift the dialogue from product-centric pitches to problem-solving discussions. Focus on how security enables Friesland Campina's strategic initiatives, such as securing IoT devices for regenerative agriculture, ensuring supply chain integrity for global reach, or protecting intellectual property for new product development.
Collaborative Approach: Emphasize NCC Group's willingness to "combine forces and share knowledge" 15, mirroring Friesland Campina's "Power of We" culture. Propose joint workshops or knowledge-sharing sessions to build rapport and demonstrate expertise.
Proof of Concept/Pilot Projects: Propose smaller, targeted engagements to demonstrate tangible value and build trust. Examples could include an OT security assessment at a key production facility, a security review of a specific digital transformation initiative, or a vendor security assessment of a critical third-party supplier.
ESG Integration: Explicitly link cybersecurity solutions to Friesland Campina's sustainability goals and strong corporate reputation. Demonstrate how security protects their "license to operate" by safeguarding environmental data and enhancing brand trust through resilient operations.
Post-M&A Support: Offer specialized security due diligence and integration services for future acquisitions, particularly relevant given their ongoing consolidation activities, such as the planned merger with Milcobel. This addresses a recurring and critical need.

Conclusions & Recommendations
Friesland Campina is a resilient, purpose-driven organization undergoing significant digital and operational transformation. Its cooperative structure, global reach, and commitment to sustainability shape its strategic priorities and decision-making. The company's recent financial rebound and explicit focus on digital initiatives, led by forward-thinking executives, indicate a readiness for strategic investments in cybersecurity.
For NCC Group, the opportunity lies in positioning itself as a trusted, independent partner that understands Friesland Campina's unique context. This involves moving beyond traditional, transactional security sales to a consultative approach that directly addresses their strategic objectives.
Key Recommendations for NCC Group's Sales Team:
Lead with Strategic Value: Frame all security offerings not just as technical solutions, but as enablers for Friesland Campina's "Expedition 2030" goals, profitability, operational resilience, and sustainability commitments. Demonstrate how security protects their brand, ensures product quality, and safeguards the long-term interests of their member farmers.
Target Key Digital and Operational Leaders: Prioritize engagement with Kemal Cetin (Chief Business and Digital Solutions Officer) and Carlo Alexander Schreurs (CISO). Their mandates and philosophies align directly with advanced, innovation-enabling security solutions. Also, engage David Cutter (CSCO) on supply chain and OT security, and Mireille Einwachter (CSO) on how security supports ESG initiatives.
Emphasize Independent Assurance and Specialized Expertise: Given Friesland Campina's extensive outsourcing partnership with Wipro, highlight NCC Group's role as an independent third-party validator. Offer specialized services in areas where a large outsourcer might not provide deep, objective expertise, such as niche penetration testing, advanced threat modeling, or security architecture reviews of outsourced environments.
Focus on OT and Supply Chain Security: Friesland Campina's core business as a food manufacturer, its extensive production facilities, and its focus on regenerative agriculture imply a critical need for robust OT security. Position NCC Group's expertise in securing industrial control systems and the entire "grass to glass" supply chain as a unique and highly relevant value proposition.
Leverage M&A Security Expertise: With the ongoing trend of industry consolidation and the planned Milcobel merger, offer specialized M&A security services, including pre-merger due diligence and secure integration planning. This demonstrates an understanding of their dynamic corporate development.
Adopt a Collaborative and Consultative Sales Approach: Mirror Friesland Campina's "Power of We" culture by fostering collaborative discussions, proposing joint workshops, and demonstrating a willingness to share knowledge. Building trust and long-term relationships will be paramount in navigating their consensus-driven decision-making process.
Prepare for Formal Procurement: Be ready to engage through SAP Ariba and Coupa Supplier Portal, ensuring that all bids and proposals clearly articulate the strategic value and alignment with Friesland Campina's procurement philosophy of seeking "value-creating sourcing solutions."
By adopting this tailored and strategic approach, NCC Group can effectively position itself as an indispensable partner in securing Friesland Campina's future growth, innovation, and enduring cooperative success.
