Go-to-Market Analysis: NCC Group Targeting Ontario Power Generation
Executive Summary
Ontario Power Generation (OPG), a Crown corporation wholly owned by the Province of Ontario, stands as the cornerstone of the province's electricity supply, generating approximately half of its power needs. With a diverse portfolio encompassing nuclear, hydroelectric, and thermal generation, alongside emerging investments in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), hydrogen, and energy storage, OPG is navigating a period of significant transformation. This transformation is driven by ambitious decarbonization goals (net-zero company by 2040, enabling a net-zero economy by 2050), aging infrastructure requiring extensive refurbishment, and the imperative to meet Ontario's growing energy demands.
OPG's financial profile is robust, with annual revenues consistently exceeding $7 billion and substantial assets valued at over $70 billion. However, its net income is subject to variability due to planned operational outages and the regulatory environment overseen by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB). The organization is currently undertaking massive capital expenditure programs, including the $12.8 billion Darlington Refurbishment, the multi-billion dollar Pickering Refurbishment (currently in definition phase), and the pioneering Darlington New Nuclear Project (DNNP) for SMRs, estimated at $20.9 billion for four units. These projects, while crucial for Ontario's energy future, introduce considerable execution and financial risks, including significant cybersecurity challenges.
The technical environment at OPG is a complex hybrid of legacy Operational Technology (OT) systems, particularly within its extensive hydroelectric and existing nuclear fleet, and modern Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, including a strategic shift to SAP S/4HANA for financials and Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform. This IT/OT convergence, coupled with the deployment of new technologies like IoT (drones for grid monitoring) and AI, expands OPG's digital attack surface. Cybersecurity governance is stringent, mandated by multiple regulatory bodies including the OEB (Ontario Cyber Security Standard), NERC (CIP standards), and the CNSC (nuclear-specific regulations). Key cybersecurity leadership resides with Ranjika Manamperi, OPG's Chief Information Officer, with IT oversight falling under the CFO and Corporate Services Officer, Aida Cipolla, indicating a strong emphasis on risk management and financial prudence in technology investments.
Recent security incidents, such as an information breach by a former employee and a cyberattack on a key contractor (Black & McDonald), underscore the tangible cyber threats OPG faces, particularly concerning insider risk and supply chain vulnerabilities.

Part 1: Ontario Power Generation - Organization Profile & Leadership
1.1. Corporate Overview
Ontario Power Generation Inc. (OPG) is a provincially owned Crown corporation, functioning as a "government business enterprise".1 Established in April 1999 following the restructuring of the former Ontario Hydro, OPG is wholly owned by the Government of Ontario.3 This ownership structure imbues OPG with a dual mandate: to operate as a commercial entity maximizing value for its shareholder, the Province, and to fulfill a public service role by providing reliable and increasingly clean electricity to Ontarians.2 This dual role inherently shapes its strategic decision-making, investment priorities, and operational posture, often leading to a more conservative risk appetite and a strong emphasis on public accountability and regulatory adherence compared to purely commercial entities. Any significant disruption to its services, particularly from a cyber incident, would carry severe repercussions beyond financial implications, affecting public trust and carrying political weight.
OPG's current headquarters is located at the Intact Centre, 700 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario.3 However, the organization is in the process of relocating its corporate headquarters to the former General Motors Canada building at 1908 Colonel Sam Drive in Oshawa, Ontario. This move, driven by economic and sustainability considerations over constructing a new facility, commenced with a phased staff transition in 2024, with full occupancy anticipated in 2025.3 Such a significant relocation and consolidation into a retrofitted facility likely entails substantial IT infrastructure review, potential upgrades, and integration efforts, presenting a window of opportunity for cybersecurity assessments and services to secure new or reconfigured environments.
OPG's operations are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) primarily as 22111 - Electric power generation.7 This encompasses sub-sectors including 221111 (Hydro-electric power generation), 221112 (Fossil-fuel electric power generation), 221113 (Nuclear electric power generation), and 221119 (Other electric power generation).7 Corresponding Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, particularly for its nuclear operations, include 4911 (Electric Services), 4931 (Electric and Other Services Combined), and 4939 (Combination Utilities, NEC).8 These classifications underscore the diversity of OPG's generation portfolio, each segment possessing unique Operational Technology (OT) environments and distinct cybersecurity challenges.
The mission of OPG is "To build a sustainable future powered by our electricity, ideas, and people," with a vision "To electrify life in one generation".9 These statements are underpinned by core values of Safety, Integrity, Excellence, Inclusion, and Innovation.9 Central to its strategic direction is a commitment to become a net-zero company by 2040 and to enable a net-zero economy by 2050.9 This ambitious environmental agenda is a primary driver for significant investments in new clean technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and green hydrogen, alongside the refurbishment of its existing low-carbon assets.11 The intrinsic link between operational safety, reliability, and these strategic goals makes robust cybersecurity an indispensable component of OPG's future success.
As Ontario's largest generator of clean electricity, OPG supplies approximately half of the province's power.11 Its diverse generation fleet includes nuclear power plants, 66 hydroelectric stations, one biomass station, one solar facility, and, through its subsidiary Atura Power, four combined-cycle natural gas turbine stations.4 OPG's dominant market share and its critical function in Ontario's energy infrastructure render its operational resilience a matter of provincial strategic importance. The expansion into novel technologies like SMRs and hydrogen introduces new operational paradigms and, consequently, novel cybersecurity considerations that must be proactively addressed.

1.2. Financial Performance & Market Position
OPG's financial performance reflects its status as a major utility with significant capital assets and a regulated revenue stream. For the fiscal year 2024, OPG reported total revenues of $7,187 million, a slight decrease from $7,434 million in 2023 and $7,349 million in 2022.14 Net income attributable to the Shareholder in 2024 was $988 million, a notable decrease from $1,741 million in 2023 and $1,636 million in 2022.15 This reduction in 2024 net income was anticipated and primarily resulted from planned cyclical outage activities at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station (specifically Unit 2) and a lower base regulated price for OPG's nuclear electricity generation approved by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB).14 The first quarter of 2025 showed a rebound, with net income attributable to the Shareholder reaching $505 million, up from $221 million in Q1 2024, largely due to increased electricity generation from the Regulated – Nuclear Generation business segment following refurbishments and lower operating, maintenance, and administration (OM&A) expenses.17 This variability underscores the significant impact of nuclear operational cycles and regulatory price-setting on OPG's financial outcomes.
As of March 31, 2025, OPG reported total assets of $71.4 billion, long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) of $12.7 billion, and equity attributable to the Shareholder of $22.1 billion.4 The organization is undertaking substantial capital expenditures, evident in the $3,725 million spent in 2024, up from $2,829 million in 2023.14 These expenditures are driven by major refurbishment projects at its nuclear facilities and investments in new generation technologies, signaling a future expansion of its asset base, which may also entail increased debt levels.
OPG maintains investment-grade credit ratings from major agencies. As of April 2025, DBRS Morningstar confirmed OPG's Issuer Rating and Unsecured Debt credit rating at A (low) and its Commercial Paper credit rating at R-1 (low), all with stable trends.19 OPG's 2024 Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) also noted S&P rating of BBB+ (Stable) and Moody’s rating of A3 (Stable).21 These ratings are supported by OPG's reasonable regulatory framework, which provides stable cash flow, implicit support from the Province of Ontario, and limited nuclear waste management liabilities. However, these strengths are counterbalanced by inherent nuclear generation risks, the potential for political intervention, the substantial ongoing capital expenditure program, and a historically high cost base that can lead to regulatory adjustments.20 DBRS Morningstar anticipates that OPG's key credit metrics may weaken moderately in the medium term due to the extensive capital program but are expected to remain appropriate for the A (low) credit rating.20 The scale of these capital projects (Darlington Refurbishment, Pickering Refurbishment, SMR development) creates distinct project phases—design, construction, and operationalization—each demanding tailored cybersecurity investments. NCC Group can strategically align its offerings to these lifecycle stages, recognizing that security requirements evolve significantly as projects mature from conception to full operation.
The OEB's role in setting regulated prices and approving cost recovery for major projects, including associated cybersecurity expenditures, is a critical factor. OPG must meticulously justify its investments to the OEB, demonstrating prudence and efficiency to ensure ratepayer value.16 Consequently, cybersecurity proposals to OPG should articulate a strong business case, emphasizing risk reduction, compliance assurance, and operational reliability.
OPG's earnings are derived from several key business segments. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) contributions were 14:
Regulated – Nuclear Generation: $337 million
Regulated – Hydroelectric Generation: $584 million
Contracted Hydroelectric and Other Generation: $242 million
Atura Power: $276 million
Regulated – Nuclear Sustainability Services: ($108) million
The Regulated – Nuclear and Hydroelectric segments are the primary earnings drivers. The negative EBIT for Nuclear Sustainability Services reflects the ongoing costs associated with nuclear waste management and decommissioning funds. The performance of these segments is directly linked to generation output, which is influenced by maintenance schedules, refurbishment activities, and, for hydroelectric, water flow conditions.

1.3. Organizational Structure & Operations
OPG's operational footprint is extensive, spanning across Ontario and into the United States. In Ontario, the company operates 75 generating stations, strategically located across Central, Eastern, Northeastern, Northwestern, Southern (Durham and Niagara Regions), and Southwestern Ontario.11 Key nuclear assets include the Darlington Generating Station in Clarington and the Pickering Generating Station in Pickering.12 OPG also owns the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station in Kincardine, which is leased to and operated by Bruce Power L.P..4 The hydroelectric portfolio comprises 66 stations on 24 river systems, including major facilities on the Niagara, St. Lawrence, Ottawa, and Madawaska Rivers.4 Thermal generation includes the Lennox Generating Station (dual-fuel oil/gas) and the Atikokan Generating Station (biomass), with subsidiary Atura Power operating four combined-cycle gas turbine stations.4 OPG also operates the Nanticoke Solar Facility and the Western Waste Management Facility in Bruce County.11
Beyond Ontario, OPG's US presence is managed through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, which owns or operates 85 hydroelectric stations and holds minority interests in 14 additional hydro and two solar facilities.4 The sheer scale and geographic dispersion of these assets, encompassing a mix of modern and aging facilities, present considerable logistical and security challenges for monitoring, maintenance, and unified incident response.
OPG's corporate structure includes several wholly-owned subsidiaries that support its diverse energy portfolio and strategic initiatives 3:
Atura Power: Operates four combined-cycle gas turbine stations in Ontario, crucial for providing flexible power during peak demand. Atura is also spearheading OPG's initiatives in low-carbon hydrogen production and battery storage solutions.22

Laurentis Energy Partners: Offers specialized services in nuclear and hydroelectric generation, including inspections, engineering, SMR licensing and development, and the production of medical isotopes.22
PowerON Energy Solutions: Provides turnkey fleet electrification services to help customers decarbonize their operations.22 It is noteworthy that OPG divested its interest in the Ivy Charging Network to Hydro One in Q1 2025.21 These subsidiaries, while operating with a degree of autonomy tailored to their specific business lines, align with OPG's overarching strategic goals. This structure implies that while cybersecurity policies may be centrally governed by OPG, their implementation could vary across diverse OT environments within each subsidiary, necessitating a nuanced approach to security assessments and solutions.
OPG employs a significant workforce, with figures cited as over 10,000 or 11,000 employees province-wide.12 The Darlington Refurbishment project alone is projected to support approximately 14,000 jobs annually through 2055.24 This large, distributed workforce, heavily involved in critical operations and major projects, inherently expands the potential attack surface, increasing risks related to insider threats, phishing attacks, and secure remote access requirements.
A significant organizational realignment occurred in the latter half of 2020, aimed at enhancing efficiency and project delivery. This restructuring involved combining nuclear and renewable generation business units, centralizing operations support under a unified Enterprise Operations organization, integrating major project planning and execution under an Enterprise Projects organization, and amalgamating business development and strategic activities into an Enterprise Strategy organization.25 While this structure was outlined in a 2020 document, the current executive team composition reflects its continued influence.27 Understanding this matrix of decentralized operations (due to asset diversity and geography) and centralized strategic functions is crucial for navigating OPG's decision-making processes, particularly for cybersecurity solutions that may require enterprise-wide adoption or site-specific tailoring.
1.4. Leadership & Governance
OPG's governance and strategic direction are steered by its Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team. The Board is chaired by Wendy Kei, appointed in June 2019, and comprises individuals with diverse expertise in finance, law, and the energy industry, including Anju Virmani, a former CIO with a keen interest in technology governance.3 Directors are elected by the Minister of Energy, acting as the sole shareholder on behalf of the Province of Ontario, underscoring the public accountability inherent in OPG's operations.2

1.5. Strategic Direction & Key Initiatives
OPG's strategic direction is heavily focused on modernizing its existing asset base while simultaneously pioneering new clean energy technologies to meet Ontario's future electricity needs and achieve its ambitious climate goals. This dual focus translates into several large-scale, multi-year capital projects and initiatives, each with significant technological and cybersecurity dimensions.
Major Projects:
The Darlington Refurbishment is a cornerstone project, a 10-year, $12.8 billion initiative to extend the operational life of the four-unit Darlington Nuclear Generating Station by at least 30 years.16 Unit 1 successfully returned to commercial operations in November 2024, ahead of schedule, and is now capable of producing life-saving Cobalt-60 medical isotopes.14 The refurbishment of Unit 4, the final unit, is currently in the reassembly phase and is on track for completion by the end of 2026, with the overall project remaining on time and within budget.14
Concurrently, OPG is advancing the Pickering Refurbishment for Units 5-8. The Province of Ontario approved the project definition phase in January 2025, with an OPG Board-approved budget of $4.1 billion for this phase, bringing the total project budget to date to $6.2 billion.14 This phase, expected to last through 2026, will finalize cost estimates, schedules, and detailed engineering plans.21 Once refurbished, these units are anticipated to provide over 2,000 MW of baseload capacity by the mid-2030s.33 Pickering Units 1 and 4 ceased commercial operation in October and December 2024, respectively, and are being prepared for decommissioning.21
A landmark initiative is the Darlington New Nuclear Project (DNNP), which will see the deployment of Canada's first grid-scale Small Modular Reactor (SMR), utilizing GE-Hitachi's BWRX-300 technology.11 Following site preparation, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) issued a Licence to Construct the first SMR in April 2025, with the Provincial government approving the start of construction in May 2025.17 The first 300MW unit is expected to be operational by the end of 2030. OPG plans a fleet of four SMRs at the Darlington site, providing a total of approximately 1,200 MW.37 The total estimated cost for the four-unit project is approximately $20.9 billion, with the first unit and shared infrastructure budgeted at around $7.7 billion.17 This pioneering role in SMR deployment positions OPG as an innovator but also exposes it to the inherent cybersecurity risks associated with "first-of-a-kind" technology, where established threat models and operational data are limited, necessitating proactive and adaptive cybersecurity strategies from the outset.
Looking further ahead, OPG is exploring opportunities for new large-scale nuclear generation at its Wesleyville site near Port Hope, following a request from the Ontario government in January 2025.16 This site has the potential for up to 10,000 MW of new nuclear capacity. Early engagement with the Municipality of Port Hope and local Indigenous communities, including the Williams Treaties First Nations, is underway.36
In the hydroelectric sector, OPG is actively modernizing and optimizing existing assets and pursuing new developments.11 This includes plans to refurbish and expand several Northern Ontario hydro stations to secure up to 830 MW of capacity.14 A significant greenfield development is underway in the Moose River Basin, in partnership with Taykwa Tagamou Nation and Moose Cree First Nation, for the proposed Nine Mile Rapids and Grand Rapids stations, which could add up to 430 MW.17 The Matabitchuan GS redevelopment (12MW) is also in execution.18
OPG's subsidiary, Atura Power, is central to its diversification into emerging clean energy solutions. Key projects include the Niagara Hydrogen Centre, a 20MW green hydrogen production facility expected to be operational in 2026 11, and the Napanee Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), a 250MW facility planned for 2026.21 Atura is also expanding the Napanee Generating Station by 405MW.21
The sheer velocity and technological diversity of these concurrent major projects create immense pressure on OPG's resources and supply chain. This heightened activity, coupled with reliance on numerous external vendors (e.g., GEH, CanAtom, Aecon Kiewit, ScanTech AI, PM7G), significantly expands the cybersecurity attack surface and elevates the risk of supply chain compromises, a concern explicitly noted in OPG's risk disclosures.21
Commitment to ESG, Climate Change, and Indigenous Reconciliation:
OPG's strategic direction is deeply intertwined with its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments. The company aims to be a net-zero entity by 2040 and a catalyst for an economy-wide net-zero transition by 2050.10 This is evidenced by its historic closure of coal-fired power plants and its current focus on nuclear, hydro, SMRs, hydrogen, and solar power.3
Indigenous Reconciliation is a key pillar, manifested through its Reconciliation Action Plan and numerous partnerships with Indigenous communities on energy projects, such as the Lower Mattagami and Peter Sutherland Sr. hydroelectric stations, the Nanticoke Solar Facility, and the new Moose River Basin hydro developments.9 OPG's commitment is further demonstrated by its PAR Gold Designation from the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business and its inclusion of Cedar Leaf Capital, an Indigenous-owned investment dealer, in its green bond syndicate.17 OPG regularly publishes an Integrated ESG and Annual Report and utilizes a Sustainable Finance Framework for its green bond issuances.11
Recent major announcements reflect this strategic momentum. Q1 2025 saw strong financial results and crucial approvals for the Darlington SMR project.17 The 2024 financial results, reported in March 2025, highlighted progress on nuclear and hydro refurbishments and new nuclear exploration.16 The deployment of advanced AI-driven CT security scanners at nuclear plants in January 2025 by ScanTech AI is a direct indication of OPG's investment in sophisticated security technologies for its critical assets.45
OPG has received recognition for its corporate culture, including being named one of Canada's Best Diversity Employers for 2023 and receiving the PAR Gold designation for Indigenous relations.42 These accolades underscore OPG's values and may influence its selection of partners who demonstrate similar commitments.

This focus on values and responsible corporate citizenship suggests that OPG may favor partners who demonstrate similar commitments and ethical practices.
OPG's procurement process is formal and structured, designed to be fair, open, and transparent.47 Prospective suppliers must typically meet OPG's qualification standards and provide comprehensive information about their company and offerings.48 For service providers, registration with ISNetworld is a common requirement.48 New suppliers are generally required to submit a request for evaluation using OPG's Supplier Self Request Form, often managed through platforms like Ariba.47 It is important to note that registration in these supplier databases does not guarantee contracts; OPG awards contracts based on established procedures for competitive bidding, thorough evaluation (including financial and quality assurance checks), and negotiation.48
A key element of the procurement framework is the Supplier Code of Conduct, which outlines expected standards of ethical behavior, compliance with laws, disclosure of conflicts of interest, and rules regarding gifts and entertainment.47 Adherence to this Code is mandatory for OPG suppliers. For its nuclear operations, OPG maintains a Certificate of Authorization (CoA) for Pressure Boundary activities, which is renewed every three years following an audit by an Authorized Inspection Agency (AIA).47 This underscores the stringent quality and compliance demands placed on suppliers, particularly those involved in the nuclear sector.
OPG actively encourages its suppliers to explore business opportunities with Indigenous businesses, aligning with its Reconciliation Action Plan.43 The company has demonstrated this commitment through partnerships such as including Cedar Leaf Capital (Canada’s first majority Indigenous-owned investment dealer) in its green bond dealer syndicate and establishing a Vendor of Record agreement with PM7G, a joint venture that includes Makhos Staffing Solutions, a Certified Indigenous Business.43 This explicit focus on Indigenous economic participation suggests that potential suppliers, like NCC Group, could enhance their value proposition by demonstrating their own Indigenous engagement strategies or partnerships. Proactive engagement with OPG's procurement systems and a clear demonstration of qualifications, financial stability, ethical standards, and alignment with OPG's values, including Indigenous reconciliation, are crucial for any vendor seeking to do business with OPG.
