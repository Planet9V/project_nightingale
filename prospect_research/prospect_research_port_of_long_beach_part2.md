Go-to-Market Analysis: Port of Long Beach
GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
Report Prepared for NCC Group Sales Team
Executive Summary
The Port of Long Beach (POLB) stands as a pivotal gateway for trans-Pacific trade and a significant economic engine for the United States. Governed by the City of Long Beach through its Harbor Department and a five-member Board of Harbor Commissioners, the Port operates as a landlord port, leasing facilities to tenants and generating revenue through these leases and cargo operations.1 Founded in 1911 4, POLB has grown into the nation's second-busiest container port, handling cargo valued at over $300 billion annually and supporting millions of jobs nationwide.1
Key organizational characteristics include its substantial physical footprint of 3,200 acres of land and 35 miles of waterfront 1, a strong financial position with operating revenues in the hundreds of millions 10, and a workforce of approximately 570 full-time employees within the Harbor Department.8 The leadership team, spearheaded by CEO Mario Cordero and overseen by the Board of Harbor Commissioners, is currently navigating significant strategic initiatives. These include a $3.2 billion 10-year capital improvement program focused on zero-emission (ZE) infrastructure and on-dock rail 12, and the pioneering Green Port Policy.1
Recent developments highlight strong cargo volume growth, with 2024 marking a record year 24, and continued investment in environmental sustainability and community engagement programs.12 Competitively, POLB is a critical component of the San Pedro Bay port complex, which collectively dominates West Coast container traffic.29 Its primary competitor is the adjacent Port of Los Angeles. POLB differentiates itself through its commitment to environmental leadership, operational excellence, and significant infrastructure modernization efforts.21 The organization's culture emphasizes sustainability, innovation, and community partnership.18
Organizational Profile
1. Organization Overview
Full Legal Name and Corporate Structure: The Port of Long Beach (POLB) is a non-operating landlord port. It is a department of the City of Long Beach, California, officially known as the City of Long Beach Harbor Department.1 The Harbor Department manages the Port under the policy direction of a five-member Board of Harbor Commissioners, appointed by the Mayor of Long Beach and confirmed by the City Council.2 Port lands are owned by the City of Long Beach in trust for the people of the State of California and cannot be sold to private enterprises.3
Analysis: The landlord port model means POLB itself does not handle cargo but leases facilities to terminal operators. This structure implies that security responsibilities may be shared or delineated between the Port Authority (Harbor Department) and its tenants. NCC Group's engagement might need to address both entities.
Year Founded, Headquarters Location, and Significant Operational Locations:
Founded: June 24, 1911.4
Headquarters: 925 Harbor Plaza, Long Beach, CA 90802.35 The Port Administration Building is also listed at 415 W. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90802.13
Significant Operational Locations: The Port encompasses 3,200 acres of land with 35 miles of waterfront, 10 piers, 80 berths, and 72 gantry cranes.1 It includes 22 shipping terminals: 6 container, 5 break bulk, 6 dry bulk, and 5 liquid bulk terminals.6 The Port operates within the San Pedro Bay, adjacent to the Port of Los Angeles.30 Key projects like the Pier B On-Dock Rail Support Facility and the proposed Pier Wind facility represent significant operational development areas.12
Organizational History and Key Milestones:
1911: Founded on 800 acres of mudflats.5
1917: First Board of Harbor Commissioners formed.5
2005: Green Port Policy established, a landmark environmental initiative.1
2017: Mario Cordero appointed Executive Director.1
2021: Busiest year in history at the time, handling 9.38 million TEUs.1
2021: Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT) Middle Harbor Redevelopment Program ($1.5 billion, 10-year project) mostly completed.10
2024: Handled a record 9.65 million TEUs.24
Ongoing: Multi-billion dollar capital improvement program focusing on modernization, rail, and zero-emissions technology.12
Analysis: The Port's history shows a consistent trajectory of growth, modernization, and an increasing focus on environmental sustainability. These large-scale development projects, particularly in rail and zero-emissions technology, introduce new and complex Operational Technology (OT) environments that require specialized cybersecurity.
Industry Classification and Primary Business Activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):
Primary Business Activities: Landlord port, managing and developing shipping terminals, leasing facilities to tenants, facilitating trans-Pacific trade, goods movement, and related maritime commerce.1
NAICS Code: 488310 - Port and Harbor Operations.46 This includes harbor operation, waterfront terminal operation, seaway operation, harbor maintenance (except dredging), docking facility operations, port facility operation, and canal operation.46
SIC Codes: 4491 - Marine Cargo Handling (dock and pier operations); 4499 - Water Transportation Services, NEC (lighthouse and canal operations).47
Precise Company Size Metrics:
Annual Revenue (Operating Revenue for Harbor Department):
FY 2025 (budgeted): $760 million (operating revenue estimated to be 6.8% higher than FY2024 budget).14 Note: The $760M is the total budget, not purely operating revenue. The FY25 operating revenue is projected to be higher than the FY24 budget's operating revenue.
FY 2023 (actual): $618.6 million (From Comprehensive Annual Financial Report FY2348)
FY 2022 (actual): $479.6 million 11
FY 2021 (actual): $434.6 million 10
Analysis: The consistent upward trend in operating revenue indicates a healthy financial position and capacity for investment in new technologies and security measures. The Port's budget for FY2022 was $622.4 million 1, and the approved budget for FY2025 is $760 million.14
Employee Count (Harbor Department): Approximately 570 full-time employees as of March 2024.8 Earlier figures mention nearly 550 (March 20227) and 500 (2017-2022 timeframe1). The Information Management division is one of the key divisions.13
Market Capitalization: Not applicable, as it is a department of the City of Long Beach and not publicly traded.2
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
Cargo Volume Growth: Ended 2024 with 9.65 million TEUs, up 20.3% from 2023 and a 2.8% increase from the previous record in 2021.24 First quarter of 2025 showed continued import growth.3 April 2025 was the strongest April on record.76
Financial Trajectory: Positive, with increasing operating revenues and significant capital investments planned ($3.2 billion over 10 years for capital improvements, including $368.3 million capital budget for FY25).12
Analysis: Strong growth and financial health suggest POLB has the resources for strategic investments, including cybersecurity, especially to protect its expanding and modernizing infrastructure.
Complete Geographic Footprint:
Located in San Pedro Bay, 25 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.30
Occupies 3,200 acres (13 kmÂ²) of land with 35 miles (40 km) of waterfront in the city of Long Beach, California.1 Includes 4,600 acres of water.6
Comprises 12 piers, 80 berths, and 22 shipping terminals.6
Features 100 miles of on-dock railroad track.12
The Port's jurisdiction is the Harbor District of Long Beach.3
The Port's interactive map provides details on facility and tenant information, projects, and environmental initiatives.12
Detailed Corporate Structure:
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: The Port of Long Beach (Harbor Department) is a department of the City of Long Beach.1 It is not a subsidiary in the traditional corporate sense but operates under the City's charter.
Business Units and Divisions: The Harbor Department is organized into several bureaus and divisions. An older organizational chart (FY2018) listed: Executive Offices, Finance and Administration Bureau, Commercial Operations Bureau, Planning and Environmental Affairs Bureau, and Engineering Services Bureau.33 More recent information indicates a structure including:
Board of Harbor Commissioners 13
Executive Offices 13
Commercial Services Bureau (formerly Commercial Operations, includes Business Development, Tenant Services, Security, Information Management) 53
Engineering Services Bureau (includes Program Management, Construction Management, Project Controls, Survey, Engineering Design, Maintenance) 17
Finance and Administration Bureau (includes Finance, Information Management, Real Estate, Risk Management) 13
Planning and Environmental Affairs Bureau (includes Environmental Planning, Master Planning, Transportation Planning) 23
Strategic Advocacy Bureau (oversees Government Relations, Communications and Community Relations) 63
Specific Divisions listed on the contact page include: Business Development, Central Procurement Services, Communications and Community Relations, Construction Management, Engineering Design, Environmental Planning, Finance, Government Relations, Human Resources Services, Information Management, Maintenance, Port Planning, Program Delivery, Program Management, Project Controls, Real Estate, Security, Survey, Tenant Services.13
Recent Restructuring Initiatives:
The Commercial Services Bureau was formerly the Commercial Operations Bureau.53
Creation of the Central Procurement Services Division was mentioned in January 2024.95
Creation of the Strategic Advocacy Bureau, overseeing Government Relations, and Communications and Community Relations, with Adrian G. Granda appointed Director of Government Relations in May 2024.63
Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT) Middle Harbor Redevelopment Program: A major ~$1.5 billion, ten-year project combining and modernizing two terminals, mostly completed in FY2021/FY2022, enhancing on-dock rail and cargo capacity.10
Gerald Desmond Bridge Replacement Project: Opened to traffic in October 2020, demolition of old bridge anticipated by end of 2023. Ownership transferred to Caltrans in March 2022.10
Analysis: The ongoing capital projects and divisional adjustments reflect a dynamic organization adapting to growth and new priorities (like zero emissions and enhanced rail). These changes, especially in IT-related and operational divisions, can create opportunities for new security assessments and solutions. The creation of a Central Procurement Services Division might streamline or change how technology and services are acquired.
Merger and Acquisition History: Not applicable in the traditional corporate sense. The Port expands through land development and infrastructure projects rather than M&A of other companies.
Ownership Structure:
The Port of Long Beach is a department of the City of Long Beach.1
It is governed by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners.2
Port lands are held in trust by the City of Long Beach for the people of California under the Tidelands Trust.3
Not publicly traded; no private equity ownership.2
The Port operates as an enterprise fund, meaning it generates its own revenues and is not typically supported by city taxes for its operations.1
Analysis: As a public entity and enterprise fund, its financial decisions, including large technology or security investments, are subject to public oversight and a structured approval process likely involving the Board of Harbor Commissioners and potentially the City Council for very large expenditures or policy changes.
Information Gaps for Section 1:

Professional Social Media: No direct LinkedIn profile URL found.
Eddie Galang, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):
Tenure: Port of Long Beach's first CISO. Date of appointment not specified, but profile published Sept 2023.72
Career History & Previous Organizations: Over 28 years in technology. Retired U.S. Army combat veteran (Special Operations, Infantry, Armor).72 Previous CISO roles at loanDepot, Fremont Investment and Loan, H&R Block Bank/Option One Mortgage.72 Worked for PwC, PacifiCare Health Systems, County of Los Angeles.72
Educational Background: Not specified in snippets.
Areas of Expertise & Focus: Full autonomy across cybersecurity (Technical Operations, Governance, Risk & Compliance).72 Data protection, asset/infrastructure security, IT security, risk/compliance management. Proactive threat management, security awareness training.72 Supply chain security is a major challenge.72
Public Speaking/Affiliations: Sits on advisory boards, speaks at conferences (RSA, etc.), recently spoke with White House Director of Cyber Security.72 Leadership Board, CyberRisk Collaborative Los Angeles.115
Professional Social Media: No direct LinkedIn profile URL found.
Chief Technology Officer (CTO): No individual explicitly holds the title "CTO" in the provided snippets. Technology strategy and implementation appear to be distributed between the CIO (Nyariana Maiko) for IT/IM, the CISO (Eddie Galang) for cybersecurity, and potentially engineering leadership (Suzanne Plezia) for OT aspects of infrastructure projects. Robert Taylor, President of Taylor Machine Works, was interviewed by Mario Cordero about manufacturing and supply chain, not a POLB CTO.78 Nick Collica is a tech strategist but not linked to POLB in snippets.116
Analysis: The absence of a dedicated CTO might mean that technology strategy is more federated. NCC Group may need to engage with multiple leaders (CIO, CISO, heads of engineering/operations) to understand the full technology landscape and purchasing drivers.
Ryan D. Manning, Director of Security Services:
Tenure: Appointed January 2024, assumed role April 2024.55 Reports to Managing Director of Commercial Services Bureau (Casey Hehr).55
Career History & Previous Organizations: Retired U.S. Coast Guard Captain. Former Captain of the Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach and Commander of Coast Guard Sector LA-LB.55 Former CO, Coast Guard Activities Europe.55 Former Chief, Office of Port and Facility Compliance, USCG HQ.55
Educational Background: Commissioned from U.S. Coast Guard Academy (1994) (B.S. Civil Engineering 118).55 M.S. Mechanical Engineering, Naval Postgraduate School; M.S. Joint Campaign Planning and Strategy.55 Registered Professional Engineer (Mechanical).68
Areas of Expertise & Focus: Physical security, emergency management, risk mitigation, public safety partnerships. Administers staff of >100 and budget of >$40M. Leads Joint Command and Control Center.55
Contact: Security Division Phone: (562) 283-7800.13
Professional Social Media: No direct LinkedIn profile URL found.
Analysis: Ryan Manning leads physical security and emergency response. Eddie Galang leads cybersecurity (CISO). There will be significant overlap and need for coordination between physical and cybersecurity, especially concerning OT environments. Casey Hehr, as Managing Director of Commercial Services, oversees both the Security Division (Manning) and the Information Management Division (Maiko). This places Hehr in a key coordinating role for overall security and technology strategy within his bureau.
Compliance and Risk Management Leadership: Likely falls under the CISO (Eddie Galang) for cyber risk and compliance, and potentially the CFO (Sam Joumblat) for financial risk and broader enterprise risk. The Director of Security Services (Ryan Manning) would also be involved in operational risk and compliance with maritime security regulations.
Digital Transformation Leadership: CIO Nyariana Maiko leads IT initiatives, including business process improvements and system implementations.54 COO Noel Hacegaba is leading the Supply Chain Information Highway digital initiative.51
Analysis: Digital transformation projects, like the Supply Chain Information Highway, are prime opportunities for NCC Group, as they introduce new technologies, connectivity, and data flows that require robust security and potentially new compliance considerations.
Middle Management in Relevant Departments:
IT Infrastructure Managers: Specific names not found in snippets. Would report to CIO Nyariana Maiko.
Security Operations Managers: Specific names not found. Would report to CISO Eddie Galang for cyber SOC and Director of Security Ryan Manning for physical security operations.
Network and Systems Administrators: Specific names not found. Would report within the Information Management division under CIO Nyariana Maiko.
Procurement and Vendor Management Contacts:
Central Procurement Services Division: Phone (562) 283-7598, Email: procurement@polb.com.13 No specific director name found for this division in the snippets, though its creation was noted in Jan 2024.95
The City of Long Beach Purchasing Division has general contact information: (562) 570-6200, LBPurchasing@longbeach.gov.119 However, the Port, as an enterprise fund, likely has significant autonomy in its procurement, especially for specialized services. The Port uses "Planet Bids" for its vendor portal.42
Analysis: The Central Procurement Services Division at the Port is the primary contact. Understanding their specific processes for technology and security service procurement is crucial.
Decision-Making Patterns:
Organizational Decision Structures: Policy set by Board of Harbor Commissioners; CEO implements policy and manages Harbor Department.3 Bureau Managing Directors/Directors oversee their respective areas and report up the chain (e.g., to COO or CEO).
Known Approval Processes for Technology Purchases:
All technology-related purchases for the City of Long Beach (which includes the Harbor Department as one of its departments) "shall be approved by the Department of Technology and Innovation" (TID) of the City of Long Beach.121
However, the Port of Long Beach operates as an enterprise fund with its own budget and a high degree of operational autonomy.1 The CFO, Sam Joumblat, oversees the Information Management division within his bureau.37 CIO Nyariana Maiko is the Director of Information Management.54
Analysis: There's a potential ambiguity: City guidelines state City TID approval for all tech purchases 121, but the Port's status as an enterprise fund with its own CIO and CFO suggests significant internal control over its IT budget and procurement. It is highly probable that the Port's CIO and CFO, along with the CISO for security-specific tech, have primary approval authority for most IT and cybersecurity purchases, with Board approval needed for very large expenditures or those impacting policy. The City TID's role might be more for city-wide standardization or larger shared services if any, rather than direct line-item approval for Port-specific operational systems. This needs clarification but leaning towards Port autonomy for its operational and security technologies.
The Port uses its own "Planet Bids" system for vendor registration and contract bidding 42, reinforcing its procurement autonomy.
Budget Authorities and Financial Approval Thresholds:
CEO Mario Cordero leads the Harbor Department with a FY2025 budget of $761 million.20
The Board of Harbor Commissioners approves the annual budget.14 The budget is then sent to the Long Beach City Council for approval.14
For City of Long Beach purchases (general guidelines):
$0 - $2,500: Department issues Direct Purchase Order (DPO).121
$2,500 - $25,000: Department issues DPO, informal bidding (3 quotes) required.121
$25,000 - $50,000 (for some categories, threshold may vary): Purchasing Division issues Blanket/Standard Purchase Order (BPO/SPO) after ITB/RFP; City Manager Purchasing Approval Form (CMAF) required.121
$50,000 (or other threshold) - $200,000: Similar to above, but if <3 bids or protest, City Council approval may be required.121
$200,000: City Council approval required.121
Analysis: While these are City guidelines, the Port's enterprise fund status and its own Board of Harbor Commissioners likely mean that the Board holds significant budget authority for Port-specific expenditures, with City Council providing ultimate oversight on the overall budget. The CFO and relevant Managing Directors/Division Directors would have delegated authority within their approved budgets. NCC Group should assume that significant contracts will require Board approval.

    %% Note: CISO's direct reporting line to a specific Managing Director or CEO/COO is not explicitly clear from snippets, but often CISOs report to CIO, COO, or CEO. Given CIO is under CFO, and Security Director is under MD Commercial Services, CISO likely aligns closely with MD Commercial Services or COO/CEO for strategic cyber initiatives. For this chart, placing under MD_CS as a peer to Dir_Sec for cyber aspects.
