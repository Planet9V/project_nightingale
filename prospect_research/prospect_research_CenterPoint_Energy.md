Go-to-Market Analysis: CenterPoint Energy

Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
1.1. Corporate Overview
CenterPoint Energy, Inc., a publicly traded entity on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CNP 1, stands as a significant player in the North American energy delivery sector. This NYSE listing subjects the company to a considerable level of regulatory oversight and mandates extensive public disclosure, providing a degree of transparency into its operations and financial health.
The company's headquarters are located in Houston, Texas 1, strategically positioning it within a primary hub of the U.S. energy industry. CenterPoint Energy proudly holds the distinction of being the only Texas-domiciled investor-owned utility.1 Its core operations encompass electric transmission and distribution, natural gas distribution, and various energy services. These activities primarily serve customers across Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas.1 While some older or broader informational materials also mention operations in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma 3, recent strategic divestitures, notably the sale of its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) 5, have refined its geographic focus to these core four states. Specialized services, such as the CenterPoint Energy Home Service Plus® program, continue to be offered in specific markets like Minnesota.7 The multi-state operational footprint means CenterPoint Energy navigates a complex and varied regulatory environment, with each state potentially imposing unique requirements and presenting distinct operational challenges. This diversity necessitates adaptable technology and security solutions tailored to regional specifics, a factor that should inform any engagement strategy.
CenterPoint Energy's corporate vision is "to lead the nation in delivering energy, service, and value".7 This vision is underpinned by a set of core values: Safety, Integrity, Accountability, Initiative, and Respect.9 Furthermore, the company expresses a commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion within its workforce and in its interactions with customers, contractors, suppliers, and communities.10 These stated principles offer a window into the company's aspirational culture. The pronounced emphasis on "safety" and "value" can be strategically leveraged by demonstrating how robust cybersecurity measures directly contribute to both the physical safety of operations and the overall value delivered to stakeholders. The value of "Initiative" may suggest an organizational openness to considering and adopting innovative solutions. The corporate culture also strongly emphasizes ethics and compliance, evidenced by established codes of conduct for both employees and suppliers, alongside regular culture surveys and ethics training programs.9 Such a robust ethics and compliance framework can create a receptive environment for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) related services.
The lineage of CenterPoint Energy extends back over 150 years through its predecessor companies.1 Its historical roots trace to the Houston Electric Light and Power Company, founded in 1882.3 The modern entity, CenterPoint Energy, Inc., was formed in 2002 through the significant merger of Reliant Energy's electric transmission and distribution business with the natural gas distribution operations of NorAm Energy.3 Another key historical milestone was the acquisition of Houston Lighting & Power in the same year, 2002.3
The company's history is also marked by a series of strategic mergers, acquisitions (M&A), and divestitures that have shaped its current structure and focus. Notable M&A activities include the acquisition of Vectren Corporation, a transaction partly funded by senior note offerings in August 2019 12; the company's Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Monica Karuturi, played a key role in leading this $6 billion merger.13 In January 2017, CenterPoint Energy Services (CES), a subsidiary, acquired Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM), which expanded CES's operational footprint to 32 states.14 More recently, CenterPoint Energy has undertaken several divestitures, including its Energy Systems Group (ESG), as noted in its Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 financial reports 5, and its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas LDCs, which were sold to Bernhard Capital Partners in a $1.2 billion deal announced in February 2024 and closed in April 2025.16 The company also previously held a significant stake in Enable Midstream Partners, LP, which has since been divested.4 This long history combined with ongoing M&A and divestiture activities suggests a potentially complex and evolving technological landscape. Such organizational flux, characterized by the integration and separation of systems, data, and security protocols, inherently creates a persistent need for cybersecurity assessment, integration, and remediation services. Each M&A event, whether an acquisition or a divestiture, presents distinct security challenges, from ensuring secure data migration and system compatibility during integrations to guaranteeing complete and secure data separation and the elimination of residual access or vulnerabilities during divestitures. These activities often result in a heterogeneous technology environment, which can complicate unified security management. The pattern of divestitures, in particular, signals a strategic intent to concentrate on core utility operations.
CenterPoint Energy's primary business activities are organized into distinct segments. The Electric segment includes electric transmission and distribution operations, primarily serving the greater Houston area and southwestern Indiana, and power generation capabilities, with nearly 1,300 megawatts of capacity in Indiana.4 This segment serves over 2.9 million metered electric customers.7 The Natural Gas segment focuses on the distribution of natural gas to approximately 7 million homes and businesses across its core service territories of Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas.1 While some older sources indicate a broader customer base and geographic spread for natural gas 4, recent divestitures have concentrated these operations. The Energy Services segment includes offerings like CenterPoint Energy Home Service Plus® in Minnesota and a partnership with HomeServe in Mississippi and Texas for home service repair plans.7 The company has also historically operated competitive energy businesses in nearly 40 states, though some, like Energy Systems Group, have been divested.4 Regulatory filings reveal a corporate structure that includes various subsidiary LLCs such as CenterPoint Energy Transition Bond Co IV, LLC, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric LLC, CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp., and SIGECO Securitization I, LLC.18 These distinct business segments, particularly Electric and Natural Gas, likely utilize different types of operational technologies (OT) and face unique security risks and regulatory demands. A tailored approach to cybersecurity, considering the specific nuances of each segment, is therefore essential. The presence of numerous subsidiaries can also add layers of complexity to enterprise-wide governance and the consistent enforcement of security policies.

The multi-state nature of CenterPoint Energy's operations, coupled with its distinct business lines in electric and gas utilities, means the company must navigate a multifaceted and demanding regulatory landscape. Each state where it operates (Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, and Texas being the primary ones) has its own Public Utility Commission (PUC) or equivalent regulatory body. These state-level entities impose specific rules and mandates, particularly concerning the protection of critical infrastructure, ensuring service reliability, and safeguarding customer data privacy. Adding to this complexity are federal regulatory bodies such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and, for the electricity sector, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), which enforces mandatory reliability standards, including Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. This diverse array of regulatory requirements significantly complicates compliance efforts for CenterPoint Energy. It necessitates the development and maintenance of robust and adaptable security frameworks capable of addressing varying jurisdictional mandates simultaneously. This environment presents an opportunity to position cybersecurity services as a means to help CenterPoint manage this regulatory complexity effectively and ensure consistent compliance across all its operations.
1.2. Financial Health and Market Position
An examination of CenterPoint Energy's financial performance over the last several years reveals a period of growth followed by more recent fluctuations. For the trailing twelve months (TTM) ending March 31, 2025, revenue was reported at $8.94 billion.20 For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 (FY 2024), annual revenue was $8.64 billion, a slight decrease of 0.61% year-over-year from the $8.70 billion reported for FY 2023.20 This followed a more significant decrease of 6.71% in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022's revenue of $9.32 billion. Prior to these decreases, the company saw growth, with FY 2022 revenue increasing by 11.60% over FY 2021's $8.35 billion, and FY 2021 revenue growing by 12.59% over FY 2020's $7.42 billion.20 These revenue trends, particularly the recent contractions, may influence spending priorities across the organization, potentially leading to increased scrutiny on operational expenditures even as capital investments remain high.
As of May 2025, CenterPoint Energy's market capitalization stood at approximately $24.26 billion 22, with other sources around the same period reporting similar figures between $24.24 billion and $24.63 billion.2 This substantial market capitalization reflects a large, established company with the capacity for significant investments, including those in critical areas like cybersecurity.
Recent financial highlights underscore the company's operational performance and strategic financial management. For the fourth quarter of 2023, CenterPoint reported GAAP earnings per diluted share (EPS) of $0.30 and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.32. For the full year 2023, GAAP EPS was $1.37, while non-GAAP EPS reached $1.50, marking a 9% increase over the 2022 non-GAAP EPS.15 Performance continued into 2024, with Q4 2024 GAAP EPS at $0.38 and non-GAAP EPS at $0.40. Full-year 2024 figures showed GAAP EPS of $1.58 and non-GAAP EPS of $1.62.5 For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported GAAP EPS of $0.45 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, while reiterating its full-year 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.74-$1.76, which targets an 8% growth.6
A key indicator of the company's future focus is its significantly increasing 10-year capital investment plan. This plan was increased to $44.5 billion through 2030 in February 2024 15, further raised to $47.5 billion in February 2025 5, and most recently augmented to $48.5 billion in April 2025.6 The company's asset base has also grown, from approximately $38 billion as of December 2022 24 to around $44 billion by March 2025.1 This consistent growth in non-GAAP EPS and the aggressive expansion of its capital investment plan demonstrate underlying financial strength and a strong commitment to long-term infrastructure projects. These large-scale capital plans represent prime opportunities for embedding cybersecurity measures from the initial design phases, ensuring that new infrastructure is secure by design. The emphasis on non-GAAP EPS in financial communications suggests a strategic focus on presenting a consistent and positive growth narrative to investors.
The ownership structure of CenterPoint Energy is predominantly institutional. Figures suggest that institutional investors hold between approximately 74.17% and 97.89% of the company's stock 2, with insiders holding a small fraction, around 0.22% to 0.42%.2 Public companies and individual investors account for the remainder, approximately 25.61%.25 Prominent institutional shareholders include major investment firms such as Vanguard, American Mutual Fund, iShares, and T. Rowe Price.26 Such high institutional ownership often correlates with a heightened focus on corporate governance, long-term stability, and sustainable value creation, all of which align with the objectives of proactive and robust cybersecurity programs. Services aimed at protecting shareholder value through risk mitigation are likely to be well-received.
The scale of CenterPoint Energy's capital investment plan, now at $48.5 billion through 2030 6, underscores the capital-intensive nature of the utility industry. Such massive expenditures on infrastructure upgrades, modernization, and new energy projects necessitate significant financing. Recent activities, including an $800 million common stock offering with a forward component in May 2025 2 and a $1.2 billion senior notes offering in August 2019 (partially to fund the Vectren acquisition) 12, confirm this reliance on capital markets. This financial strategy, while common for utilities, can increase the company's exposure to scrutiny from credit rating agencies and investors regarding its management of operational risks, including cybersecurity. A major cyber incident could potentially impact CenterPoint's financial stability, its credit ratings, and its ability to access capital on favorable terms. Therefore, cybersecurity measures that demonstrably mitigate these financial risks are of strategic importance.
While the company is channeling substantial funds into capital expenditures and reporting growth in non-GAAP EPS, the recent trend of flat or declining revenues 20 suggests a potential underlying pressure to manage operational expenditures (O&M) effectively. Utilities frequently face the challenge of balancing investments in long-term, rate-based assets with the need to control immediate operational costs that directly impact profitability. The Q1 2025 financial results, for instance, indicated that increased financing and O&M costs partially offset gains from growth and regulatory recovery.6 In this context, cybersecurity solutions should be positioned not merely as a cost center, but as a strategic investment that can prevent far more significant financial losses arising from cyber incidents. Furthermore, opportunities to highlight how advanced security solutions might also introduce operational efficiencies, perhaps through automation in security operations or streamlined compliance processes, could be particularly compelling.

1.3. Leadership and Governance
The strategic direction and operational execution at CenterPoint Energy are guided by its executive leadership team and overseen by its Board of Directors. Recent changes in key leadership positions signal areas of renewed focus and potential shifts in strategy.
Executive Leadership Team:
Jason P. Wells assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer on January 5, 2024.28 He joined CenterPoint Energy in 2020, initially serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and later as President and Chief Operating Officer. His prior experience includes serving as Executive Vice President and CFO at PG&E Corporation.30 Christopher A. Foster was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 5, 2023.28 Like Wells, Foster also came from PG&E Corporation, where he was EVP & CFO. This shared background at PG&E, a utility that has navigated significant operational, safety, and financial challenges, is particularly relevant. Leaders emerging from such an environment are likely to possess a heightened awareness of risk management, the critical importance of infrastructure resilience, the intensity of regulatory scrutiny, and the complexities of crisis management. This experience could translate into a greater organizational impetus at CenterPoint Energy for proactive cybersecurity measures, especially concerning Operational Technology (OT) and critical infrastructure, to preempt similar challenges.
Monica Karuturi holds the crucial role of Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Her extensive portfolio includes oversight of the legal department, risk management functions (which explicitly encompass cyber and physical security, ethics, compliance, and privacy), supply chain, human resources, and emergency management.13 The fact that the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer (CECO) report to her underscores the strategic importance of legal, risk, and compliance considerations in the company's security posture.33 This reporting structure often indicates that cybersecurity is viewed primarily through a lens of risk mitigation and regulatory adherence, rather than solely as a technical IT function. Karuturi's central role in overseeing these interconnected risk domains makes her a critical figure in cybersecurity governance.
Jason M. Ryan serves as Executive Vice President, Regulatory Services & Government Affairs, having joined CenterPoint Energy in 2009.28 Kenneth E. (Kenny) Coleman has been the Senior Vice President & Chief Information Officer (CIO) since November 16, 2020.35 He is responsible for the enterprise-wide IT strategy, including the security of IT systems, and previously served as SVP & CIO at Southern Company. Coleman initially reported to Gregory Knight, then EVP of Customer Transformation and Business Services 36; however, Knight has since left CenterPoint Energy (now at Boston Consulting Group as of November 2024 37), which may have led to a change in the CIO's direct reporting line and potentially a re-evaluation of IT priorities or organizational structure.
A significant development in the security leadership is the appointment of a new, yet publicly unnamed, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in September 2024.33 This individual brings over two decades of global leadership experience in cybersecurity, technology, and industrial systems from a Fortune 500 industrial company and reports directly to the EVP & General Counsel, Monica Karuturi.33 The arrival of a new CISO typically initiates a period of review and assessment of the existing cybersecurity program, strategy, personnel, and vendor relationships, usually within the first six to twelve months. This phase presents a timely window of opportunity to introduce new capabilities and potentially influence the CISO's evolving strategic direction and technology choices. The CISO's background in industrial systems aligns well with CenterPoint's extensive OT environment.
Shane Kimzey is identified as the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) and Deputy General Counsel in the company's 2025 Code of Ethics.38 The CECO is responsible for the day-to-day management of the data privacy program and also reports to the EVP & General Counsel.33 Other key leaders include Carla Kneipp, Senior Vice President of Procurement, Materials & Logistics 39; Keith Stephens, appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer in September 2024 40; Bertha Villatoro, appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer effective January 1, 2025 41; and Richard Leger, appointed Senior Vice President of the Gas business, also effective January 1, 2025.41

Corporate Governance Highlights:
CenterPoint Energy maintains several documented governance frameworks, including a Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers 38, an Ethics and Compliance Code applicable to all directors, officers, and employees 9, and a Supplier Code of Conduct.10 The Audit Committee's direct oversight of cybersecurity risk 33 and the Board's receipt of periodic updates on data privacy 45 further illustrate a structured approach to managing these critical risks. This commitment to strong governance suggests a corporate environment that values and expects adherence to high ethical and compliance standards.
1.4. Strategic Direction and Recent Developments
CenterPoint Energy's strategic direction is heavily focused on modernizing its infrastructure, enhancing grid resilience, transitioning towards cleaner energy sources, and improving customer experience, all supported by substantial capital investments.
Key Strategic Initiatives:
A primary focus is Grid Modernization and Resilience. The Greater Houston Resiliency Initiative (GHRI) is a cornerstone of this strategy, involving significant investments in hardening power lines, installing thousands of storm-resilient poles, aggressive vegetation management, deploying advanced automation devices like trip savers and Intelligent Grid Switching Devices, and undergrounding hundreds of miles of power lines to create a more "self-healing" electric system.5 This initiative is complemented by a recently filed $5.75 billion Systemwide Resiliency Plan for Houston Electric.5 The company's proactive stance on resilience, partly driven by experiences with events such as Hurricane Beryl 11, indicates a strategic shift. Historically, utilities might have adopted a more reactive posture to infrastructure challenges. CenterPoint's large-scale, multi-faceted GHRI, however, suggests a deep-seated commitment to embedding resilience into its infrastructure proactively. This philosophy of "resilience by design" for physical systems should ideally be mirrored by a similar proactive approach to cyber resilience, as cyber threats can cause disruptions comparable to, or even exceeding, those from physical events.
In the Clean Energy Transition, CenterPoint is actively investing in renewable natural gas (RNG), green hydrogen production (with a second facility planned in Minnesota), networked geothermal systems, and carbon capture technologies like CleanO2’s CarbinX™ device.3 These efforts support the company's goal of achieving Net Zero Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035.47
Improving Customer Experience and Communication is another strategic pillar. This includes the launch of a new cloud-based outage tracker 11 and an expanded strategic relationship with Convey to leverage intelligent customer workflows for enhanced communication, particularly during extreme weather events.49 This increasing reliance on data and digital platforms for operations and customer interaction, while enhancing service, also expands the company's digital footprint and associated data security and privacy risks. Protecting these platforms and the vast amounts of customer and operational data they handle is paramount.
These initiatives are backed by a robust Capital Investment plan, which has been progressively increased to $48.5 billion for the 10-year period through 2030.6 This capital is directed towards enhancing safety, reliability, facilitating growth, adopting innovative technology, modernizing pipelines, and advancing sustainability goals.47
Recent News and Announcements (Q4 2024 - Q2 2025):
Recent activities underscore these strategic priorities. The company announced an $800 million common stock offering in May 2025, indicating ongoing capital needs.2 In February 2025, the ERCOT Board approved CenterPoint's proposal to deploy 15 large emergency generation units to the San Antonio region, highlighting the focus on grid reliability in Texas.46 Concurrently, CenterPoint forecasted nearly 50% electric load growth demand in its Houston Electric service territory by 2031, signaling future capacity and infrastructure requirements.5 Updates on the GHRI Phase Two confirmed the completion of critical resiliency actions ahead of the 2025 hurricane season.2 Leadership transitions continued with appointments of a new CCO (Keith Stephens, Sep 2024), SVP Gas (Richard Leger, Jan 2025), CHRO (Bertha Villatoro, Jan 2025), and new Board members (Dean Seavers, Dec 2024; Manuel Miranda & Laurie Fitch, Apr 2025).40 The sale of its Louisiana and Mississippi LDCs to Bernhard Capital Partners was finalized in April 2025.6
Identified Competitors:
As a utility, CenterPoint Energy competes with or is benchmarked against other major energy companies. These include DTE Energy, Engie, Entergy, the former Energy Future Holdings, and Dynegy.51 Revenue comparables also include Dominion Energy, OGE Energy, Sempra Energy, Atmos Energy, Oneok, MDU Resources, and ONE Gas.21 Understanding this competitive landscape helps to frame CenterPoint's motivations for operational efficiency, service reliability, and innovation.

Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture
2.1. Technology Leadership and Organization
The stewardship of CenterPoint Energy's technology and cybersecurity landscape rests with a team of experienced executives. Kenneth E. (Kenny) Coleman serves as the Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer (CIO), a role he assumed on November 16, 2020.35 His responsibilities are comprehensive, encompassing the formulation and execution of the enterprise-wide information technology strategy. This includes the development, maintenance, operational use, and crucially, the security of CenterPoint Energy's computer systems, software applications, and network infrastructure.36 Coleman brought significant utility sector experience to CenterPoint, having previously served as SVP & CIO at Southern Company, and also held the position of President & CEO of the Birmingham Business Alliance.35 He holds an MBA from the University of Alabama and a BS in Communications from the University of New Haven.35 Initially, the CIO reported to Gregory Knight, then Executive Vice President of Customer Transformation and Business Services.36 However, Knight has since departed CenterPoint Energy and joined Boston Consulting Group in November 2024.37 This change in the CIO's direct superior could potentially lead to adjustments in IT strategy, budgetary allocations, or organizational priorities. The "Customer Transformation" aspect of Knight's former role might have previously steered IT projects with a strong emphasis on customer-facing technologies; the new reporting structure for the CIO will be important to ascertain for understanding current strategic alignments.
A pivotal role in the company's defense strategy is held by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). According to the company's 10-K filing information (from a February 2025 extract), a new, publicly unnamed CISO joined CenterPoint Energy in September 2024.33 This individual is noted to possess over two decades of experience in global leadership roles focusing on cybersecurity, technology, and industrial systems within a Fortune 500 global industrial company.33 The CISO is tasked with the day-to-day management of CenterPoint Energy's cybersecurity program and, significantly, reports directly to the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Monica Karuturi.33 This reporting line, placing the CISO under the legal and risk management arm of the company rather than traditionally under the CIO, signals a strong emphasis on cybersecurity as a legal, risk, and compliance imperative. It suggests that adherence to regulatory mandates, protection of data privacy, the legal ramifications of incident response, and contractual security obligations are primary drivers of the cybersecurity strategy. The recent appointment of this CISO (September 2024) is a critical factor; new security leaders typically undertake a comprehensive review of existing strategies, vendor relationships, and team structures during their initial months. This period often presents an opportune moment for external experts to introduce capabilities that can support the CISO's evolving vision, particularly given this CISO's background in industrial systems, which is highly pertinent to CenterPoint's OT environment. (An earlier reference noted Anthony Souza as Director of Cybersecurity (CISO) at an industry event 52, but the 10-K disclosure regarding the new CISO in September 2024 is considered more definitive for the top enterprise CISO role).
CenterPoint Energy does not appear to have an executive explicitly titled Chief Technology Officer (CTO) within its senior leadership team, based on available public information.28 The overarching technology strategy seems to be primarily under the purview of the CIO, Kenneth Coleman. Specific technology decisions, particularly those related to Operational Technology (OT) within the distinct electric and gas business units, may reside with the operational leadership of those segments. This structure suggests that while the CIO sets the enterprise IT strategy, the implementation of specialized technologies, especially in OT or areas like cloud and application security, might involve a distributed approach with dedicated teams. For instance, job postings for an "Enterprise Architect" 16 and a "Mid-Level Manager, Cloud and Application Security" 54 point towards a sophisticated and somewhat decentralized model for technology architecture and specialized security functions. This implies that a multi-faceted engagement strategy may be necessary, targeting the CIO for broad IT initiatives, the CISO for enterprise security and GRC, specialized security managers for detailed technical solutions, and potentially business unit leaders for OT-specific security needs.
Several other key executives are integral to CenterPoint's technology, security, and compliance ecosystem. As mentioned, Monica Karuturi (EVP & General Counsel) is a central figure, with ultimate oversight of risk management, including both cyber and physical security, as well as ethics, compliance, and privacy functions. The CISO and the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer (CECO) report directly to her.13 Shane Kimzey is identified as the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) and Deputy General Counsel in the 2025 Code of Ethics 38, responsible for the day-to-day management of the data privacy program and reporting to the EVP & General Counsel.33 (Note: Carol R. Helliker has also been associated with this or similar roles in past references 55). In the procurement domain, Carla Kneipp (SVP Procurement, Materials & Logistics) is a key contact for understanding purchasing processes and vendor engagement.39 Her team includes Brandon Oliver (VP Supply Chain and Strategic Sourcing) and Steven Harrington (Director, Indirect And Digital Procurement).39 Job postings further reveal mid-level leadership and specific areas of focus, such as a Director for Financial Systems 57, indicating attention to securing financial data and processes, and the aforementioned Manager for Cloud and Application Security, whose responsibilities include securing GCP, Azure, IBM, and SaaS environments, and embedding security into the SDLC through DevSecOps practices (SAST, DAST, API security, IaC scanning, container and runtime protection).54

2.2. IT and OT Landscape (Inferred)
As a major utility with extensive electric and natural gas operations serving approximately 7 million customers, CenterPoint Energy's IT and OT landscape is necessarily complex and diverse. Core systems likely include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms such as SAP or Oracle to manage critical business functions like finance, human resources, and supply chain logistics; a job posting for an SAP SM/PM Configurator/Support Consultant confirms the use of SAP.16 The need for a Director of Financial Systems also points to sophisticated financial platforms requiring dedicated management and security.57 Customer Information Systems (CIS) and associated billing systems are essential for managing interactions and transactions with its large customer base.
For its electric operations, CenterPoint undoubtedly relies on Grid Management Systems, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Energy Management Systems (EMS), and Distribution Management Systems (DMS). Similarly, its natural gas operations would utilize SCADA systems for pipeline monitoring and control. Comprehensive Asset Management Systems are also expected to be in place to track and maintain the company's vast network of physical infrastructure. Specific operational technologies mentioned include the Picarro Surveyor™ advanced leak survey technology for methane detection in its gas operations and ZEVAC® (Zero Emission Vacuum and Compressor) systems for environmentally responsible pipeline maintenance.47 Each of these core systems—from corporate ERPs holding sensitive financial data to critical SCADA/OT systems controlling energy delivery—presents unique and significant security challenges.
The drive towards modernization and efficiency is evident in the company's increasing adoption of cloud technologies. A job posting for a "Mid-Level Manager, Cloud and Application Security" explicitly details responsibilities for securing various cloud environments, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications.54 A concrete example of this cloud adoption is the launch of a new, cloud-based outage tracker designed to improve customer communication and information dissemination.11 This strategic shift to the cloud is likely aimed at leveraging benefits such as scalability for data analytics, enhanced agility for customer-facing applications, and potentially for hosting various business support functions. However, this migration also introduces new security paradigms, including managing the shared responsibility model, implementing cloud-native security tools, and ensuring robust configuration management to prevent misconfigurations that can lead to breaches.
CenterPoint Energy is also making significant strides in the use of data analytics and automation. CIO Kenneth Coleman has explicitly stated the company's intent to "continue to leverage technology, data and analytics to support enterprise-wide business goals".36 This is manifested in the Greater Houston Resiliency Initiative (GHRI), which includes the installation of thousands of automated devices such as trip savers and Intelligent Grid Switching Devices, aiming to build a "self-healing" electric grid.11 Further supporting data-driven operations is the plan to install 100 weather stations for real-time weather monitoring.46 This push towards increased automation in grid operations and the extensive use of data for predictive maintenance, outage management, and deriving customer insights means that the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of these systems and the data they generate are of paramount importance. Securing data analytics platforms and the vast, distributed network of automated and IoT devices deployed in the field presents a substantial and ongoing security challenge.
The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) is a significant trend shaping CenterPoint Energy's technical landscape. The strategic goal of creating a "self-healing system" 11 through the deployment of automated field devices and the leveraging of data analytics 36 necessitates increased connectivity and data exchange between traditional IT networks and OT networks. Smart grid initiatives, widespread automation, and remote monitoring capabilities require OT systems—such as SCADA, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and various field sensors—to communicate with IT systems, including data centers and cloud platforms, for data processing, advanced analytics, and, in some cases, control actions. This convergence effectively breaks down the traditional "air gap" that once aimed to isolate OT environments, thereby exposing critical OT systems to a broader range of cyber threats that can propagate from IT environments or vice versa. While this integration unlocks significant efficiencies and new operational capabilities, it also creates a more complex and interconnected attack surface.
Compounding this complexity is the likelihood that CenterPoint Energy, with a history spanning over 150 years and numerous mergers and acquisitions 1, operates a heterogeneous mix of modern and legacy systems. Long-established utility companies often possess aging infrastructure components, including older OT devices and IT systems that can be difficult and costly to replace or upgrade. Furthermore, M&A activities frequently result in the absorption of disparate systems from acquired entities, each with its own technological foundation and security posture. While CenterPoint is making substantial investments in modernization efforts like the GHRI and cloud adoption, these legacy systems are likely to persist for some time. Such systems often suffer from unpatched vulnerabilities, lack modern security features, and can be challenging to integrate securely with newer technologies. This creates a multifaceted security environment that requires specialized assessment methodologies and tailored mitigation strategies to address the risks posed by both aging and cutting-edge technologies.
2.3. Key Technology Initiatives and Investments
CenterPoint Energy is actively pursuing several key technology initiatives focused on enhancing grid resilience, innovating in energy delivery, and improving customer engagement, all underpinned by a substantial capital investment program.
Grid Modernization and Resiliency Programs are at the forefront of these efforts. The Greater Houston Resiliency Initiative (GHRI) stands out as a flagship program.5 Phase One, now completed, involved hardening power lines, extensive vegetation management, the installation of over 1,100 stronger, storm-resilient poles, the deployment of more than 300 automated devices to reduce outage duration, and the launch of a cloud-based outage tracker.11 Phase Two, which aims for completion before the 2025 hurricane season, is even more ambitious, targeting the installation or replacement of 25,000 to 26,000 poles meeting extreme wind standards, the deployment of 4,500 to 5,150 additional automation devices (including trip savers and Intelligent Grid Switching Devices), clearing high-risk vegetation across 4,000 to 6,000 miles of power lines, undergrounding over 400 miles of power lines, and installing 100 new weather stations for real-time monitoring.11 Complementing GHRI, CenterPoint has also filed a $5.75 billion Systemwide Resiliency Plan with Texas regulators for its Houston Electric operations.5 Further demonstrating its commitment to regional grid stability, the company received ERCOT Board approval for a proposal to utilize 15 large emergency generation units (27MW-32MW each) to support the San Antonio area grid.46 These large-scale initiatives involve the deployment of a vast number of new, interconnected devices, significantly expanding the IoT/OT footprint and, consequently, the attack surface that must be secured.
The company is also making significant Investments in Innovative Technologies, particularly within its Natural Gas Business, which has a $16 billion capital investment plan through 2030 focused on safety, reliability, growth, innovative technology, and pipeline modernization.47 In Minnesota, CenterPoint's five-year innovation plan, approved under the Natural Gas Innovation Act (NGIA), includes pilot projects for Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), the development of a second green hydrogen production facility, networked geothermal systems, hybrid heating solutions, and industrial decarbonization technologies.47 To reduce methane emissions, the company employs advanced technologies such as a large fleet of Picarro Surveyor™ vehicles for sensitive leak detection, ZEVAC® systems for capturing gas during pipeline maintenance, and CleanO2’s CarbinX™ carbon capture units.47 Furthermore, CenterPoint is leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies through partnerships with companies like Neara and Technosylva to better predict and prepare for extreme weather impacts.36 The adoption of these cutting-edge technologies, while promising, introduces new and potentially immature systems that require thorough security vetting and continuous monitoring.
A clear Focus on Customer-Facing Technologies is also evident. The new cloud-based outage tracker 11 and an expanded strategic relationship with Convey aim to transform customer communications by using intelligent customer workflows, especially during disruptive events like extreme weather.49 CEO Jason Wells emphasized this as a "commitment to modernizing...the way we communicate with them, leveraging technology...".49 These digital platforms, which handle sensitive customer data and are critical for maintaining customer trust, represent high-value targets for cyber attackers.
The extensive deployment of new hardware (such as smart poles, sensors, and advanced automation devices 11) and sophisticated software solutions (including AI-powered tools and customer communication platforms 36) sourced from a multitude of vendors significantly amplifies supply chain risk. Each new technological component, whether physical hardware or a software application, originates from an external supplier. Consequently, the security of CenterPoint Energy's increasingly complex infrastructure becomes intrinsically linked to, and dependent upon, the security practices of these numerous third-party vendors. A security compromise at a critical supplier could potentially lead to malicious code, counterfeit components, or exploitable vulnerabilities being embedded in products deployed within CenterPoint's vital operational systems. This heightened exposure necessitates robust supply chain security assessment programs and comprehensive vendor risk management frameworks.
Furthermore, strategic initiatives such as the installation of 100 new weather stations 46, the widespread implementation of grid automation technologies 11, and the adoption of AI-driven predictive analytics 36 will collectively generate an enormous and continuous deluge of data. These new and expanded data sources are fundamental to improving operational efficiency, enhancing grid reliability, and delivering superior customer service. However, the sheer volume, velocity, and variety of this data—characteristic of Big Data environments—demand highly resilient and secure data management infrastructures. Protecting this data throughout its lifecycle—during transit across networks, while at rest in storage systems, and during processing by analytical engines—is critical. Breaches could lead to unauthorized access, malicious manipulation (which could, in turn, trigger incorrect and potentially hazardous operational decisions), or exfiltration of sensitive information, underscoring the need for advanced data security measures and privacy-preserving techniques.

2.4. Cybersecurity Posture and Governance
CenterPoint Energy publicly identifies "Cybersecurity and Data Privacy" as "Priority Topics," underscoring a strategic commitment to safeguarding customer, employee, regulated, and sensitive information, as well as protecting its digital systems from cyberattacks.48 Extracts from its 10-K filing (February 2025) indicate that its risk management process includes identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating cybersecurity risks to both its Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. The company's cybersecurity program is reportedly aligned with industry-recognized frameworks, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and encompasses key elements like threat intelligence, vulnerability management, security awareness training, incident response, and recovery planning.33 This stated alignment with established frameworks suggests a structured and mature approach to cybersecurity.
Board-level oversight is a critical component of CenterPoint's cybersecurity governance. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is tasked with overseeing cybersecurity and data privacy management, which includes reviewing associated risks and disclosures.33 This committee receives quarterly reports from senior leadership, including the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, the CISO, or other representatives from the cybersecurity or data privacy groups.33 The full Board of Directors also receives periodic updates on these matters.45 This high level of oversight signifies that cybersecurity is treated as a significant business risk requiring executive and board attention.
The company maintains a Data Privacy Program aimed at minimizing risks to customer, employee, financial, and critical infrastructure information.45 This program is led by the Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel, and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) – identified as Shane Kimzey – who reports to the EVP & General Counsel.33 Key components of this program include a Data Classification and Control Policy, a Corporate Privacy and Security Incident Response Plan, and robust vendor risk management processes focused on privacy. All employees are required to complete annual privacy and information security training.45 The leadership of the data privacy program by the legal and compliance function indicates a strong focus on regulatory adherence, such as compliance with state-specific data breach notification laws and other applicable privacy regulations.
CenterPoint Energy states that it conducts various types of security assessments, testing, and audits to proactively identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities across its IT and OT systems.33 While specific types of testing are not always detailed in high-level documents, it can be inferred that these activities likely include penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance audits against standards such as NERC CIP (for electric operations) and potentially PCI DSS if payment card data is handled directly. A job posting for a "Mid-Level Manager, Cloud and Application Security" specifically mentions the implementation or expansion of Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scanning 54, indicating that these advanced testing practices are part of their security regimen. This stated commitment to regular assessments and testing creates direct avenues for specialized security service providers.
Regarding incident response preparedness, CenterPoint's cybersecurity program explicitly includes incident response and recovery planning 33, and a formal Corporate Privacy and Security Incident Response Plan is in place.45 The company has a well-documented history of conducting extensive emergency response exercises, often in collaboration with local partners and ERCOT, primarily focused on physical events like hurricane season and winter storms.2 While this demonstrates a strong culture of emergency preparedness, cyber incident response, particularly for sophisticated attacks on OT systems or large-scale data breaches, requires specialized playbooks, tools, and training distinct from physical disaster recovery.
The combination of a publicly stated mature security approach, including NIST framework alignment and regular assessments 33, with the recent appointment of a new CISO in September 2024 33, suggests a cybersecurity program that is established yet likely undergoing a period of review and potential evolution. A new CISO, especially one with an industrial systems background as reported 33, will invariably conduct a thorough evaluation of the inherited program and may seek to implement enhancements, particularly in areas like OT security. This phase represents an opportune moment for external security partners to offer strategic advice, specialized assessments (focused on OT, cloud, or application security, for example), and assistance in implementing new initiatives that align with the CISO's vision and address any identified gaps.
The organizational structure, where both the CISO and the CECO report to the General Counsel 33, combined with CenterPoint's operations in a heavily regulated industry, strongly implies that compliance is a major driver for cybersecurity spending and strategy. Failure to adhere to a complex web of regulations—including NERC CIP standards, state PUC rules, and various data privacy laws—can result in severe financial penalties, operational disruptions, and significant reputational damage. The legal department's direct oversight ensures that cybersecurity measures are not only technically sound but also rigorously meet all pertinent legal and regulatory obligations. Consequently, cybersecurity services should be framed in terms of their contribution to achieving and maintaining compliance, as well as mitigating these multifaceted risks.
2.5. Technology Procurement and Decision-Making
Understanding the technology procurement process and the key factors influencing purchasing decisions at CenterPoint Energy is crucial for effective sales engagement. Procurement is led by Carla Kneipp, Senior Vice President of Procurement, Materials & Logistics.39 Her team includes key personnel such as Brandon Oliver, Vice President of Supply Chain and Strategic Sourcing, and Steven Harrington, Director of Indirect and Digital Procurement.39 For inquiries related to the Coupa procurement platform, the contact email is DigitalProcurement@centerpointenergy.com.59 CenterPoint Energy also maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct and operates a supplier diversity program, indicating expectations for its vendor partners.10
Several factors likely influence technology and cybersecurity purchasing decisions at CenterPoint Energy. Reliability and resilience are paramount, driven by the operational imperative to prevent outages, the impact of extreme weather events, and high customer expectations, as evidenced by major initiatives like the GHRI 11 and the ERCOT emergency generation proposal.46 Regulatory compliance is a non-negotiable driver, given the stringent requirements from NERC, FERC, state PUCs, environmental agencies, and data privacy laws. Security itself is a core consideration, focusing on the protection of critical OT/ICS infrastructure, sensitive customer data, and corporate financial systems. While investing heavily in capital projects, cost efficiency and value remain important, requiring a balance between capital expenditures (capex) and operational expenditures (O&M), and a preference for solutions that offer a clear return on investment or prevent larger financial losses; Q1 2025 results, for instance, noted pressures from O&M costs.6 There is also a clear appetite for innovation, with investments in new technologies for cleaner energy, enhanced grid operations, and improved service delivery, such as the Minnesota Innovation Plan 47 and the use of AI for weather prediction.36 Safety is a foundational company value that influences all operational and technological choices.9 Finally, enhancing the customer experience through improved communications and service delivery, as seen in the Convey partnership 49 and the new outage tracker 11, is a significant driver for technology adoption.
The substantial scale of CenterPoint's capital plan, now at $48.5 billion 6, and the magnitude of initiatives like the GHRI 11, necessitate a highly strategic approach to sourcing and robust vendor management capabilities within the procurement organization. Successfully deploying billions in capital requires the careful selection, onboarding, and ongoing management of a multitude of vendors, including providers of advanced technology and specialized cybersecurity services. The procurement leadership under Carla Kneipp 39 will play a pivotal role in ensuring that these vendor relationships deliver value, effectively manage inherent risks (including critical supplier security risks), and align with broader corporate objectives such as supplier diversity.10 Companies seeking to partner with CenterPoint Energy should be prepared for a formal and potentially rigorous procurement process, emphasizing their stability, deep expertise, and capacity to support long-term strategic initiatives.
While CenterPoint Energy demonstrates a clear commitment to investing in innovation—evidenced by its exploration of renewable natural gas, hydrogen technologies, and AI applications 36—its fundamental nature as a regulated utility, with a primary obligation to provide safe and reliable service, means that the adoption of new technologies, especially for critical operations, will likely be a carefully vetted and deliberate process. Utilities are typically more conservative than other sectors in embracing brand-new or unproven technologies due to the high stakes associated with reliability and safety. Purchasing decisions are often heavily influenced by factors such as regulatory approval pathways, established cost recovery mechanisms, and clear, demonstrable benefits. Although there is a discernible appetite for innovation, as seen in initiatives like the Minnesota NGIA plan 47, technology and service providers should frame their offerings, particularly newer or more advanced security solutions, with compelling evidence of efficacy, a strong return on investment, and clear alignment with the specific needs, risk tolerance, and regulatory environment of the utility sector. Pilot projects, similar to the approach taken with the CarbinX™ carbon capture technology 47, may represent a preferred pathway for evaluating and adopting new technologies within CenterPoint Energy.

Effective incident response handling for a major utility or industrial client.
Assisting a utility in achieving or maintaining NERC CIP compliance.
3.5. Engagement Strategy and Next Steps
A proactive and informed engagement strategy is key to initiating a successful relationship with CenterPoint Energy.
Recommended Channels for Initial Outreach:
Direct Outreach to the new CISO: Given the CISO's recent appointment (September 2024 33), timely and value-led outreach is paramount. This could involve sharing relevant threat intelligence, insights on utility sector security trends, or offering a complimentary high-level briefing.
Leverage Industry Events and Forums: Identify industry conferences, CISO roundtables (such as Evanta events where CenterPoint security leadership has participated 52), or utility-specific forums where CenterPoint's technology and security leaders might be present. These offer opportunities for informal networking and introduction.
Engage Through Existing Relationships: If any NCC Group personnel have pre-existing professional connections with individuals at CenterPoint Energy or its key technology partners, these should be explored as potential avenues for introduction.
Respond to Public Procurement Notices: Monitor for any publicly available Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or other procurement notices related to cybersecurity services.
Key Questions to Ask During Discovery Calls:
To understand CenterPoint's specific needs and priorities, discovery conversations should include questions such as:
"With your recent appointment, what are your top 3-5 cybersecurity priorities for CenterPoint Energy over the next 12-18 months, and what are the key challenges you foresee in achieving them?"
"Considering the significant investments in grid modernization, like the Greater Houston Resiliency Initiative, how is CenterPoint Energy currently addressing the evolving security challenges of OT/IT convergence?"
"What are your primary security concerns related to your expanding cloud footprint (GCP, Azure, SaaS) and the increasing number of customer-facing digital applications?"
"How does CenterPoint Energy approach the assessment and management of cybersecurity risks within its extensive supply chain, particularly for critical technology components and services?"
"Given the increasing automation in your grid operations and the goal of a 'self-healing' system, how are you ensuring the security and resilience of these automated decision-making processes and the underlying data?"
"What are the most significant regulatory or compliance drivers currently shaping your cybersecurity strategy and investment decisions (e.g., NERC CIP, state-specific mandates, privacy laws)?"
Potential "Quick Wins" or Pilot Projects:
To build credibility and demonstrate value early in the relationship, NCC Group could propose targeted, well-defined pilot projects, such as:
A focused OT vulnerability assessment for a specific new component or system being deployed under the GHRI.
A cloud security configuration review for one of CenterPoint's key cloud environments (e.g., GCP or Azure).
An application security test (penetration test or secure code review) for the new cloud-based outage tracker or the platform supporting the Convey customer communication system.
A cyber tabletop exercise tailored to a specific OT-related cyber incident scenario relevant to CenterPoint's operations.
A data discovery and privacy impact assessment for a key customer data repository.
The arrival of a new CISO in September 2024 33 represents a particularly significant tactical opportunity. New security leaders almost invariably conduct a thorough review of their inherited program, personnel, processes, and technology stack. During this critical assessment phase, they are often more receptive to external expertise to gain an objective perspective and identify areas for rapid improvement or strategic redirection. This period is typically when existing vendor relationships are scrutinized, and new strategic partnerships are forged. NCC Group should prioritize timely, value-driven outreach to the CISO, offering insights, benchmarks, or focused assessments that can assist them in shaping their agenda and demonstrating early successes.
CenterPoint Energy is heavily invested, both financially and in terms of public commitment, in the concept of "resiliency," as evidenced by the GHRI 11, the Systemwide Resiliency Plan 5, and its support for ERCOT stability.46 This pronounced focus on physical resilience (primarily against extreme weather and physical disruptions) creates a powerful narrative parallel for advocating comprehensive cyber resilience. A major cyber-attack could severely undermine all the efforts and investments made in physical hardening by disabling control systems, corrupting operational data, or causing widespread service disruptions. NCC Group can effectively frame its services as essential to achieving true, holistic resilience—ensuring that CenterPoint's modernized, automated grid is not only physically robust but also cyber-secure and capable of withstanding and recovering from sophisticated cyber threats. This narrative aligns directly with the stated priorities and substantial investments of the Board of Directors and executive leadership.
The organizational structure, wherein the CISO reports directly to the Executive Vice President & General Counsel, Monica Karuturi 33, elevates the importance of engaging with the legal and compliance functions within CenterPoint Energy. This reporting line signifies that cybersecurity investments and strategies will be heavily scrutinized through the lens of legal risk, regulatory compliance, and overall corporate governance. Monica Karuturi's broad oversight, which includes cyber and physical security, ethics, and compliance 13, positions her as a key influencer, and potentially a key decision-maker, for significant security initiatives. Therefore, NCC Group's messaging should be tailored to resonate with legal and risk professionals, emphasizing due diligence, the creation of a defensible security posture, adherence to all applicable compliance regimes, and the mitigation of legal liabilities arising from potential cyber incidents.
3.6. Competitive Landscape (for NCC Group's services)
CenterPoint Energy will likely be targeted by a range of cybersecurity service providers. This competitive landscape includes:
Large Cybersecurity Consulting Firms: Global firms such as Deloitte, Accenture, EY, and PwC, which offer broad cybersecurity consulting, implementation, and managed services.

Global Reach with Local Understanding: If applicable, leverage global expertise while demonstrating an understanding of the specific U.S. regulatory and threat landscape relevant to CenterPoint.
Proven Track Record: Confidently present its experience and success in helping similar critical infrastructure organizations address complex cybersecurity challenges.
Conclusions
CenterPoint Energy is a major U.S. energy delivery company undergoing significant transformation driven by grid modernization imperatives, a transition to cleaner energy sources, and a focus on enhancing customer experience. These strategic initiatives, backed by a multi-billion dollar capital investment plan 6, create a complex and evolving technological landscape. The company's history of M&A and divestitures further contributes to this complexity, potentially resulting in a heterogeneous mix of modern and legacy IT and OT systems.
From a cybersecurity perspective, several key factors emerge. The recent appointment of a new CISO (September 2024) who reports to the Executive Vice President and General Counsel 33 signals a period of potential strategic review and an emphasis on risk management and compliance. The company's explicit focus on resilience, particularly in its Texas operations (GHRI 11), provides a strong thematic link for advocating comprehensive cyber resilience. Key technology adoption trends include cloud migration (GCP, Azure, SaaS 54), increased automation and data analytics in grid operations 11, and new customer-facing digital platforms.11
These developments present clear opportunities for a specialized cybersecurity services firm like NCC Group. The most promising avenues for engagement lie in:
