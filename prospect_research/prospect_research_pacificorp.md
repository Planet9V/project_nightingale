Go-to-Market Analysis: PacifiCorp
GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
TARGET ORGANIZATION: PacifiCorp
Executive Summary
PacifiCorp stands as a significant electric utility in the Western United States, operating as a key subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). The company functions through two primary retail divisions: Pacific Power, serving customers in Oregon, Washington, and California, and Rocky Mountain Power, catering to Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho.1 This dual structure allows PacifiCorp to manage a vast service territory characterized by diverse regulatory environments and customer needs. The organization is currently navigating a period of substantial transformation, marked by significant investments in grid modernization, a strategic shift towards renewable energy sources, and the critical, ongoing challenge of wildfire mitigation in its operational areas.1
Key organizational characteristics include its status as the largest grid operator in the West, managing an extensive transmission and distribution network.1 Its generation portfolio, historically reliant on coal, is undergoing a rapid transition towards cleaner energy sources, including wind, solar, and battery storage, as outlined in its strategic planning documents.2 PacifiCorp's leadership, currently under CEO Cindy Crane who returned in 2023 5, is tasked with steering the company through these complex operational and strategic shifts while maintaining reliability and managing costs.
Recent significant developments underscore this transformative phase. The submission of the 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in March 2025 details ambitious targets for renewable energy integration and the phasing out of coal generation.2 Continuous and substantial investments in wildfire mitigation plans reflect the pressing need to enhance grid resilience against extreme weather events.4 Furthermore, PacifiCorp's commitment to join the Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) in 2026 signals a move towards greater regional market collaboration and operational efficiency.1
Competitively, PacifiCorp operates largely as a regulated monopoly within its service territories. Its competitive positioning is therefore less about direct rivalry for customers and more about performance against regulatory benchmarks, efficient management of large-scale capital projects, and the successful execution of its energy transition strategy. The financial backing and long-term investment horizon provided by Berkshire Hathaway Energy are considerable assets in this context.8 However, the company faces substantial financial pressures from wildfire-related liabilities and the high costs associated with mitigation and infrastructure hardening.4
Organizational Profile
1.1 Full legal name and corporate structure
PacifiCorp is the current legal name of the entity.10 Historically, it was known as Pacific Power & Light Company.12 A 2012 SEC filing provides further historical context, noting that the company was initially incorporated in Maine in 1910 under the name Pacific Power & Light Company. In 1984, its name was changed to PacifiCorp. A significant structural change occurred in 1989 when it merged with Utah Power and Light Company, leading to the formation of a new Oregon corporation, also named PacifiCorp, which is the current operating entity.13 PacifiCorp operates as a regulated, vertically integrated electric utility company.13
This long and layered history, involving multiple names and re-incorporations, often points to a complex amalgamation of legal and operational legacies. For large enterprises, such evolutionary paths can result in a blend of operating procedures and potentially varied IT systems inherited from predecessor entities. These historical elements can influence the pace of contemporary decision-making and may present integration challenges when deploying new enterprise-wide technologies, a relevant consideration for comprehensive cybersecurity solutions.
1.2 Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
PacifiCorp's origins trace back to 1910 with the founding of Pacific Power & Light Company.13 While some sources mention 1984 15, this date more accurately reflects the formal adoption of the PacifiCorp name or a significant merger event, rather than the inception of its oldest constituent part.
The company's corporate headquarters is located at 825 N.E. Multnomah, Portland, Oregon, 97232, USA.12
PacifiCorp has a substantial operational footprint, serving electric customers across six Western states: California, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.1 Beyond its retail service territories, PacifiCorp owns generation resources in a total of eight states, including additional facilities in Montana and Colorado.1 The long operational history, dating back over a century, implies a high probability of encountering legacy infrastructure within its extensive network. Such aged infrastructure, particularly in the utility sector where asset lifecycles can be exceptionally long, often presents unique cybersecurity challenges compared to more recently developed, digitally native systems. This is a critical consideration, especially for Operational Technology (OT) security.
1.3 Organizational history and key milestones
PacifiCorp's history is marked by significant transformations, acquisitions, and strategic initiatives that have shaped its current structure and operational focus.
Early Development & Expansion: The Condit Dam, constructed in 1913, represents an early part of the company's heritage via Northwestern Electric Company, which merged into Pacific Power & Light in 1947.20 The company that is now PacifiCorp was formed through the 1989 merger of PacifiCorp (then primarily Pacific Power & Light) and Utah Power and Light Company.13
Changes in Ownership: In November 1999, PacifiCorp was acquired by ScottishPower.21 A pivotal change occurred in 2005-2006 when MidAmerican Energy Holdings (now Berkshire Hathaway Energy) acquired PacifiCorp from ScottishPower in a deal valued at $5.1 billion in cash plus the assumption of $4.3 billion in debt.18 This acquisition brought PacifiCorp under the umbrella of Berkshire Hathaway, likely instilling a corporate culture emphasizing financial stability, long-term investment horizons, and a potentially more conservative, risk-averse approach.
Major Infrastructure and Market Initiatives:
The Energy Gateway transmission expansion project, a multi-billion dollar initiative to add thousands of miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, was announced in 2007 and continues to be a major undertaking.1 This project underscores a long-term commitment to enhancing grid capacity and reliability.
PacifiCorp was a founding partner in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) in 2014, demonstrating early adoption of regional market solutions to improve efficiency and integrate renewables.1
The company plans to join the Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) in 2026, further deepening its participation in Western energy markets.1
More recently, the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO) announced a conditional commitment for Project WIRE, another significant transmission expansion initiative.24
Strategic Planning & Regulatory Compliance:
PacifiCorp has been publishing Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) since 1989, with the most recent being the 2025 IRP submitted in March 2025.2 These biennial plans outline long-term strategies for resource acquisition and system development.
Since the passage of California Senate Bill 901 in 2018, PacifiCorp has been developing and implementing annual Wildfire Mitigation Plans (WMPs).7
Recent Transactions: PacifiCorp acquired the Arco Wind and Solar project in February 2024.12
The continuous investment in transmission infrastructure (Energy Gateway, Project WIRE) and active participation in sophisticated energy markets (EIM, EDAM) highlight an increasing complexity and interconnectedness of PacifiCorp's network. These developments inherently expand the digital attack surface and underscore the escalating importance of robust cybersecurity measures across its operations.

A chronological perspective of these milestones reveals PacifiCorp's continuous evolution, driven by strategic acquisitions, major infrastructure investments, and responses to regulatory and environmental pressures. This historical context is valuable for understanding the current organizational structure, the potential mix of technologies in place, and the prominence of initiatives like grid modernization and wildfire mitigation, which can inform the timing and messaging of sales engagements.
1.4 Industry classification and primary business activities
PacifiCorp's primary business is that of an electric utility, encompassing the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity.12 It serves a diverse customer base, including residential, commercial, and industrial clients.12 The company is also active in wholesale electricity markets, buying and selling power.12
Its energy generation portfolio is diverse, utilizing sources such as coal, natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, and geothermal energy.1
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code primarily associated with PacifiCorp is 221122 (Electric Power Distribution).16 It also falls under the broader NAICS code 22112 (Electric Power Transmission, Control, and Distribution).26 The corresponding Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 4911 (Electric Services), with a more specific designation of 49119901 (Distribution, electric power).16
As a vertically integrated utility with a varied generation portfolio, PacifiCorp confronts a wide spectrum of cybersecurity challenges. These span traditional Information Technology (IT) systems (handling corporate functions, customer data, and market operations) and extensive Operational Technology (OT) systems (controlling generation plants, SCADA systems, and transmission and distribution networks). The increasing convergence between these IT and OT domains further complicates the security landscape, demanding a holistic approach to risk management. Each segment of its operations—generation with its diverse fuel types (coal, gas, hydro, renewables), high-voltage transmission, and widespread distribution networks potentially including smart grid elements—possesses unique assets and associated cyber risks.
1.5 Precise company size metrics
Annual Revenue (3-year trend):
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), PacifiCorp's parent, reported PacifiCorp's "Adjusted Earnings on Common Shares" as $797 million for 2023 and $969 million for 2022. Reported net earnings (loss) for PacifiCorp were $(468) million in 2023 and $921 million in 2022, significantly impacted by wildfire-related costs.4
For 2021, PacifiCorp's after-tax earnings were $889 million, with a utility margin (operating revenue less cost of fuel and purchased power) of $3.5 billion.27
For 2020, PacifiCorp's after-tax earnings were $741 million, with a utility margin of $3.3 billion.27
GlobalData estimated PacifiCorp's revenue at $6.6 billion for 2024.12
Note: Consistent, directly comparable PacifiCorp-specific operating revenue figures require careful extraction and interpretation from BHE's consolidated 10-K filings, as they are not always explicitly broken out in the same manner year-to-year in summary documents. The "utility margin" is a frequently reported metric. Accessing BHE's 10-K filings for 2023 (filed Feb 2024), 2022 (filed Feb 2023), and 2021 (filed Feb 2022) is necessary for detailed revenue data.28
Employee Count:
PacifiCorp employs approximately 5,000 to 5,200 individuals.12 Older data from around 2007-2009 indicated a higher count of 6,470-6,500.18 The 5,000-5,200 range appears to be the most current.
The Portland headquarters has approximately 1,000 employees on site.16 Detailed departmental breakdowns are not publicly available.
A large, geographically dispersed workforce, including field crews for transmission and distribution, plant operators, and corporate staff across multiple states, presents inherent challenges for consistent security policy enforcement, comprehensive training programs, and coordinated incident response.
Market Capitalization:
As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, PacifiCorp itself is not publicly traded and thus does not have a traditional market capitalization.
Certain series of PacifiCorp's preferred stock are traded on OTC markets (e.g., PPWLM, PPWLO).17 However, these represent a small portion of its overall capital structure. PPW Holdings LLC, PacifiCorp's direct parent, recently conducted a tender offer for some of these outstanding preferred shares.35
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
PacifiCorp experienced a 3.2% increase in retail customer load for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily driven by favorable customer usage in commercial and industrial classes.4
The 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2 details substantial planned capital investments in renewable generation, energy storage, and transmission infrastructure. This indicates planned growth in the company's asset base and a significant shift in its operational focus towards decarbonization.
The company's financial trajectory has been notably impacted by wildfire-related liabilities and mitigation costs. For instance, PacifiCorp recorded $1.265 billion in wildfire losses (net of recoveries and income taxes) in 2023.4
The combination of necessary investments in energy transition and the considerable financial burden of wildfire risks creates a demanding financial environment. This situation may make PacifiCorp more receptive to security solutions that are not only effective but also cost-efficient and can demonstrate a clear return on investment through risk reduction.
1.6 Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
PacifiCorp's operational footprint is extensive, covering a service territory of 141,500 square miles across six western states.1 It operates under two main retail brands:
Pacific Power: Serves 243 communities in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California.1
Rocky Mountain Power: Serves communities in Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho.1
Key operational assets include:
Customers: Approximately 2.1 million electric customers.1 Earlier figures cited 1.7 to 1.8 million customers.13
Generation Capacity: Net owned generation capacity is approximately 11,700 megawatts (MW) as of April 2025 1, or 12,231 MW as of September 2024.4 The company historically operated around 74 generating plants 22, with facilities located across its six primary service states plus Montana, Colorado, and Arizona.18 Detailed lists of thermal, hydro, wind, and solar plants are available on the company's website and in planning documents.18
Transmission System: PacifiCorp owns and operates the largest transmission system in the Western U.S. 1, comprising over 17,000 miles of transmission lines (variously reported as 17,100 to 17,500 miles).1
Distribution System: The company manages an extensive distribution network of approximately 66,300 to 66,900 miles of lines.1
Substations: Operates over 900 substations.4
The vast and varied geographic scope, encompassing diverse physical terrains (urban, rural, mountainous) and multiple regulatory jurisdictions, inherently complicates unified security management. This includes challenges in consistent policy deployment, physical security of critical infrastructure across wide areas, and coordinated incident response capabilities.
1.7 Detailed corporate structure
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships:
PacifiCorp is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc..13
Its direct parent holding company is Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), formerly known as MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (MEHC).8 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. fully acquired BHE in October 2024.40
The direct legal parent of PacifiCorp is PPW Holdings LLC, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE.13
PacifiCorp itself has, or has had, subsidiaries primarily related to its fuel supply operations, such as Pacific Minerals, Inc. (PMI), Fossil Rock Fuels, LLC, and Bridger Coal Company 13, as well as Energy West Mining Company and Glenrock Coal Company.25 Other listed subsidiaries are mainly related to employee benefit plans.14
Business Units and Divisions:
Pacific Power: Serves Oregon, Washington, and California. Headquartered in Portland, Oregon.1
Rocky Mountain Power: Serves Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.1
PacifiCorp Energy: This operational arm, also headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is responsible for operating the company's diverse portfolio of power-generating assets.18
The distinct branding and regional headquarters for Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power may suggest a degree of operational autonomy or differing regional priorities. This could influence how decisions, including those related to security investments and implementations, are made and rolled out across the different divisions. Sales approaches may benefit from being tailored to these regional distinctions.
Recent Restructuring Initiatives:
The most significant potential restructuring initiative stems from a request by Utah's governor for PacifiCorp to submit a report outlining options for corporate realignment by November 2024.4 Such a realignment could lead to substantial structural changes, potentially involving the separation of assets or the creation of new corporate entities, which would have profound implications for security responsibilities, existing infrastructure, and contractual agreements. This represents a major area of uncertainty and a potential trigger for new security assessments and solutions.
The 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2 itself details a massive restructuring of PacifiCorp's generation portfolio. This includes retiring and converting coal-fired plants while adding significant renewable energy and storage capacity. This is a strategic, operational, and technological restructuring with deep implications for OT security.
Ongoing Wildfire Mitigation Plans 7 also involve significant operational changes and investments, effectively restructuring how the company manages grid resilience and safety in high-risk areas.
Merger and Acquisition (M&A) History:
The most defining M&A event in PacifiCorp's recent history was its acquisition by MidAmerican Energy Holdings (now BHE) from ScottishPower, announced in May 2005 and completed in 2006.18 This brought PacifiCorp under the Berkshire Hathaway umbrella.
Historically, PacifiCorp merged with Utah Power & Light in 1989.13
An earlier period saw diversification into telecommunications through Pacific Telecom, though this segment was subsequently divested as the company refocused on its core energy business.41
More recent M&A activity has been smaller in scale and focused on bolstering its renewable generation portfolio in line with IRP goals, such as the acquisition of the Arco Wind and Solar project in February 2024 12 and the full ownership acquisition of the Foote Creek I wind project in August 2019 to enable repowering.23
The acquisition by BHE likely led to the standardization of many corporate functions over time, including financial reporting and potentially aspects of IT governance. However, the operational complexities of a utility mean that legacy systems and processes from pre-acquisition eras may persist. Each new asset acquisition, particularly in the renewables space, involves integrating new, often digitally controlled, generation sources into an existing grid, with each integration point presenting potential security considerations.
1.8 Ownership structure
PacifiCorp is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE).8 BHE, in turn, is a consolidated subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc..13 In October 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. completed the full acquisition of BHE.40
The direct parent entity of PacifiCorp is PPW Holdings LLC, which is an affiliate of BHE and the sole holder of PacifiCorp's common stock. PPW Holdings LLC is itself an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE.13
While PacifiCorp's common stock is not publicly traded, certain series of its preferred stock are traded on OTC markets (e.g., tickers PPWLM, PPWLO).17 PPW Holdings LLC recently concluded a cash tender offer to purchase outstanding shares of PacifiCorp's 6.00% and 7.00% Serial Preferred Stock in January 2025.35
Being part of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate means PacifiCorp has access to significant capital resources and operates under a corporate culture that typically emphasizes long-term value creation, operational efficiency, and rigorous risk management. Decisions regarding major capital expenditures, such as comprehensive cybersecurity overhauls or significant technology investments, would likely involve oversight and approval from Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Security investments that can be clearly articulated in terms of quantifiable risk reduction and long-term value preservation would align well with this ownership philosophy.

This leadership structure, with strong divisional presidents and key corporate VPs, suggests that while overall strategy is set at the PacifiCorp corporate level (with BHE influence), regional operational considerations and regulatory nuances play a significant role.
2.2 Board of Directors
PacifiCorp Board of Directors (Current, as per GlobalData 12):
Cindy A. Crane (Chairman, Executive Board)
Nikki L. Kobliha (Director, Executive Board)
Ryan L. Flynn (Director, Non-Executive Board – also President, Pacific Power)
Natalie L. Hocken (Director, Non-Executive Board)
Charles C. Chang (Director, Non-Executive Board)
GlobalData also lists three other non-executive directors with placeholder names, suggesting potential recent appointments or data updates pending.12 Another source, Forum Pacific, Inc. 62, lists a Board of Directors, but this appears to be for a different Philippines-based company named "Forum Pacific, Inc." and not PacifiCorp, the U.S. utility. This highlights the importance of verifying data sources.
Historical PacifiCorp Board Members (circa 2007-2008 18): This list included Gregory E. Abel (then Chairman & CEO of PacifiCorp), William J. Fehrman, and Patrick Reiten, among others. These individuals have since moved into broader roles within Berkshire Hathaway Energy or other organizations, but their past involvement indicates deep BHE-family ties.
Gregory Abel: Currently Vice Chair – Non-Insurance Operations at Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Chair of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.59 His previous role as PacifiCorp's CEO means he has intimate knowledge of the company.
William J. Fehrman: A senior executive within Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2006. Notably, he previously "managed Berkshire Hathaway Energy's cross-business cyber and physical security strategies".59 This past responsibility makes him a critical figure regarding overarching security philosophy and strategy influencing PacifiCorp.
Patrick Reiten: Formerly President and CEO of Pacific Power and later PacifiCorp Transmission, now leads national policy and legislative work for Berkshire Hathaway Energy.66
Board Committees: Specific committee assignments for the current PacifiCorp board are not detailed in the provided snippets. An older document (2008) mentioned that the Compensation Committee was at the PacifiCorp level, while other board committees were at the MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (now BHE) level.63 This suggests a model where strategic oversight for certain functions may reside with the parent company.
The composition of PacifiCorp's board, including its top internal executives, and the significant BHE oversight (personified by executives like Abel and Fehrman with deep historical and ongoing connections to PacifiCorp) indicates that major strategic decisions, including those on substantial cybersecurity investments, are likely made with considerable input and approval from BHE. Mr. Fehrman's past specific role in defining BHE's cross-business cybersecurity strategy is particularly noteworthy for NCC Group, as it points to a high-level executive with a direct interest and influence in this domain across BHE subsidiaries.
2.3 IT and Security Leadership
Identifying a clear, publicly designated Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) specifically for PacifiCorp (as distinct from Berkshire Hathaway Energy) is challenging based on the available public information.
Identified Security-Related Leadership:
Michael B.: Director, Corporate Security & Business Continuity at PacifiCorp.44 This appears to be the most senior dedicated security role identified directly within PacifiCorp from the available sources. His responsibilities likely cover physical security, enterprise risk management aspects of security, and ensuring business operations can continue through disruptions.
William J. Fehrman (Berkshire Hathaway Energy): As noted previously, Fehrman, a senior executive at BHE, has a history of managing BHE's cross-business cyber and physical security strategies.59 This suggests that overarching cybersecurity strategy and governance for subsidiaries like PacifiCorp may be significantly influenced or directed at the BHE parent level.
Stacy Bresler: Formerly served as Cybersecurity Manager for PacifiCorp.67 He is now Vice President at EnergySec, an organization focused on energy sector security. While not a current contact, his past role indicates that dedicated cybersecurity management functions have existed within PacifiCorp.
John Cupparo: Served as CIO at PacifiCorp until 2006.68 He later moved to senior executive roles at BHE focused on transmission and is now Chair at Southwest Power Pool (SPP). This is a historical reference.
Challenges in Identification:
Standard C-suite IT/Security titles (CIO, CISO, CTO) are not prominently featured for PacifiCorp on its official website 5, in leadership lists from financial data providers like GlobalData 12, or in recent press releases.
PacifiCorp's IT careers page 69 does not currently list open executive IT or cybersecurity leadership positions.
Third-party databases like Comparably 44 and LeadIQ 71 list some individuals with IT-related titles (e.g., "J.S. - Chief Technology Officer" on LeadIQ 71), but these require strong verification as such sources can contain outdated or user-generated information. For example, some executives listed on Comparably for PacifiCorp have verifiably moved to other organizations.
The apparent absence of highly public CIO/CISO/CTO roles at the PacifiCorp subsidiary level could imply several structural possibilities. These crucial responsibilities might be embedded within broader operational or engineering roles. Alternatively, strategic IT and cybersecurity direction, particularly for major initiatives and governance, could be heavily influenced or directly led by the parent company, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, aligning with Mr. Fehrman's historical BHE-level cybersecurity strategy role. It is also possible that security responsibilities are distributed, with corporate security and business continuity managed by individuals like Michael B., while OT security may fall under the purview of operational executives, such as the VP of Transmission.
This diffused or centralized-at-parent structure makes identifying the ultimate decision-makers and key influencers for cybersecurity solutions more nuanced. Engagement strategies may need to target a broader set of stakeholders, including operational leaders, legal and compliance teams, finance executives, alongside any identified IT and corporate security personnel. Understanding William Fehrman's current influence at BHE regarding cybersecurity standards for subsidiaries is also critical.

3.5 Analysis of Strategic Trajectory and Implications for Technology and Security Priorities
PacifiCorp is in the midst of a profound and capital-intensive transformation. This strategic trajectory is driven by multiple powerful forces: the societal and regulatory push for decarbonization, the urgent need to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather (particularly wildfires), and the imperative to modernize an aging grid to maintain reliability and accommodate new energy technologies. This transformation involves not only replacing old assets with new ones but also fundamentally changing how the grid is operated and managed.
The massive investments in new technologies—utility-scale solar, wind, battery storage (including long-duration types like iron-air), advanced transmission systems, and potentially advanced nuclear—are rapidly increasing the digitization and interconnectedness of PacifiCorp's operational environment. Each new renewable energy facility and storage system is a complex array of sensors, controllers, and communication interfaces, often remotely monitored and managed. The expansion of the transmission network through projects like Energy Gateway and Project WIRE, coupled with deeper participation in regional energy markets like EIM and EDAM, further expands the digital footprint and the number of critical network connections.
This strategic direction has direct and significant implications for PacifiCorp's technology and security priorities:
Expanded Attack Surface: The proliferation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), IoT devices within renewable and storage installations, and increased network connectivity for market operations and remote management dramatically enlarges the potential attack surface for cyber threats.
Critical Need for OT Security: The new generation and storage assets, along with the modernized transmission control systems, are all heavily reliant on Operational Technology. Securing these OT environments from cyber threats is paramount to ensuring their reliability, safety, and efficiency. This includes protecting legacy OT systems that may still be in operation and are often more vulnerable.
Data Security and Integrity: The modernized grid and market participation generate vast quantities of operational and market data. Ensuring the security, integrity, and availability of this data is crucial for reliable operations, market compliance, and informed decision-making.
Enhanced Resilience and Recovery: In the context of heightened physical threats like wildfires, the ability of cyber systems to withstand disruption and recover quickly is critical. Cyber-physical resilience—ensuring that cyber systems support, rather than hinder, physical grid resilience—is a key priority. Any cyber incident that could trigger or exacerbate an operational failure, especially one with safety or environmental consequences (like a wildfire), would have severe repercussions.
Evolving Compliance Landscape: PacifiCorp must adhere to NERC CIP standards for its bulk electric system assets. As the grid becomes more complex and new technologies are introduced, the interpretation and application of these standards will evolve. Additionally, state-level cybersecurity regulations and expectations may also increase.
Supply Chain Risk Management: Increased reliance on a diverse range of technology vendors for new systems (hardware, software, communications) elevates the importance of robust supply chain risk management to prevent the introduction of compromised components or software.
The financial strain caused by wildfire liabilities and mitigation costs creates a compelling need for security solutions that are not only highly effective but also demonstrably cost-efficient. Investments in cybersecurity will likely be scrutinized for their ability to reduce tangible risks (operational disruptions, regulatory penalties, safety incidents) and protect the massive capital investments being made in grid modernization. The potential corporate realignment sought by Utah adds a layer of strategic uncertainty that could either accelerate or redirect certain technology and security investments, depending on the outcome. During any such period of organizational change, maintaining robust security is even more critical to prevent exploitation of transitional vulnerabilities.

Regulatory Drivers: Approaching through the lens of regulatory compliance, engaging legal and regulatory affairs leaders on how NCC Group can help meet current and future cybersecurity mandates.
Preliminary Relationship-Building Strategy Insights:
Demonstrate a deep understanding of the unique challenges facing Western U.S. utilities, including decarbonization, grid modernization, and wildfire risk.
Acknowledge and align with Berkshire Hathaway Energy's operating philosophy (long-term value, financial discipline, operational excellence).
Clearly connect NCC Group's cybersecurity services to PacifiCorp's primary strategic goals as outlined in their IRP (e.g., secure integration of renewables, reliability of the modernized grid).
Position the engagement as a long-term partnership focused on mutual success and risk reduction, rather than a transactional sale.
Communication Approach Aligned with Organizational Culture:
Formal and Data-Driven: Communications should be professional, well-researched, and supported by data and relevant case studies (especially from the utility sector).
Emphasis on Core Values: Frame solutions in terms of how they enhance reliability, safety, regulatory integrity, and operational excellence.
Risk Reduction and ROI Focus: Clearly articulate how cybersecurity investments reduce tangible risks (operational, financial, reputational) and provide long-term value.
Avoid Hyperbole: Eschew overly aggressive sales tactics or fear-mongering. A measured, expert-driven approach is more likely to succeed.
Timing Considerations Based on Organizational Cycle:
Budget Cycles: Confirm PacifiCorp's fiscal year and typical budget planning timelines. Aligning proposals with these cycles is crucial.
Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) Cycle: PacifiCorp issues a new IRP every two years, with updates in the intervening years.2 These periods represent key windows of strategic planning and potential receptivity to solutions that support IRP objectives. The 2025 IRP has recently been filed.
Regulatory Filings: Deadlines for significant regulatory submissions (e.g., Wildfire Mitigation Plans 7, general rate cases 4) can create specific needs or highlight areas of focus where security is relevant.
Utah Corporate Realignment Study: The request for a report on corporate realignment options by November 2024 4 is a critical timing factor. The period leading up to and following this report could present significant opportunities as the company evaluates structural changes and associated security implications.
Major Project Timelines: Align engagement with the timelines of major initiatives like the Energy Gateway expansion, Project WIRE, or large renewable deployments, as these will have inherent security requirements.

Information Gaps Noted for Part 1
The following significant information gaps were identified during the research for Part 1 of this report:
Detailed Financials: Consistent, directly comparable PacifiCorp-specific operating revenue figures for the past three fiscal years. While earnings and utility margin data are available, a clear operating revenue trend requires deeper extraction from consolidated BHE 10-K filings.
PacifiCorp Board Details: A full, officially confirmed current list of PacifiCorp's Board of Directors, including all committee assignments and detailed profiles for non-executive directors.
Comprehensive C-Suite List: A confirmed and comprehensive list of current PacifiCorp C-suite executives beyond the CEO, CFO, and Divisional Presidents. Specifically, the roles of Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for PacifiCorp remain unclear from public sources.
Executive Profile Depth: Detailed profiles (education, full career history, specific tenure in current role, defined areas of responsibility, public speaking engagements, and professional social media presence) for most Vice Presidents and Directors within PacifiCorp.
IT/Security Middle Management: Specific names, roles, and contact information for middle management within IT infrastructure, security operations, network/systems administration, and procurement/vendor management.
Decision-Making Specifics: Detailed internal decision-making processes, lines of authority, and specific budget approval thresholds for technology and cybersecurity investments.
Fiscal Year Confirmation: Explicit confirmation of PacifiCorp's fiscal year schedule.
Departmental Employee Counts: Granular breakdowns of employee counts by department or specific operational units.
Specific Technology Vendors: Names of incumbent vendors for key enterprise IT systems (ERP, CRM), cloud services, and specific cybersecurity solutions (firewalls, SIEM, EDR, OT security platforms).
Security Incident Details: Publicly confirmed details of any past cybersecurity incidents or breaches, if any.
Security Frameworks & Certifications: Specific security frameworks (beyond NERC CIP) formally adopted by PacifiCorp (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001) and any corporate security certifications achieved.
Further research, potentially involving direct outreach or subscription-based intelligence services, would be required to fill these gaps.
