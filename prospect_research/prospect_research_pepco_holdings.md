Key engagement imperatives will involve a multi-level approach targeting decision-makers at both PHI and Exelon, tailoring value propositions to address specific operational and financial concerns, and leveraging the current environment of heightened cybersecurity awareness and infrastructure investment. This report details the organizational landscape, technical environment, and a strategic sales approach, including a battle card, to facilitate successful engagement with Pepco Holdings.
Part 1: GTM Analysis: Organization Profile & Leadership (Pepco Holdings)
Executive Summary (Part 1)
Pepco Holdings LLC (PHI) stands as a key subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, operating as a prominent electric and, to a lesser extent, gas utility in the strategically vital Mid-Atlantic United States. Its core business revolves around the regulated transmission and distribution of energy to a substantial customer base exceeding two million across Washington D.C., Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey, through its distinct operating companies: Pepco, Delmarva Power, and Atlantic City Electric.
The organizational fabric of PHI is characterized by its regulated utility status, necessitating a profound focus on operational reliability, customer satisfaction, and stringent adherence to a complex web of federal and state regulations. This is evidenced by ongoing infrastructure modernization projects, such as the recent upgrade of Pepco's historic Harvard substation, and continuous engagement with regulatory bodies through rate cases and service standard reviews.
PHI's leadership structure is firmly integrated within the Exelon framework. Recent significant appointments within PHI, including a new Chief Operating Officer (Rodney Oddoye) and a new Chief Financial Officer (Morgan O'Donnell) effective mid-2025, suggest a period of potential strategic refinement and present timely opportunities for engagement. Exelon's strategic commitment to the region and PHI is further underscored by its recent acquisition of PHI's Washington D.C. headquarters building.
In its regulated service territories, PHI operates as a de facto monopoly. However, it faces considerable indirect competitive pressures common to the utility industry. These include the imperative to meet or exceed performance benchmarks set against peer utilities, manage operational costs effectively, integrate emerging technologies like renewables and smart grid systems, and, critically, ensure robust cybersecurity. This latter focus is significantly amplified by the recent addition of a dedicated cybersecurity expert to Exelon Corporation's Board of Directors, signaling an intensified enterprise-wide commitment to mitigating cyber risks.
Organizational Profile
Full legal name and corporate structure
The primary legal entity is Pepco Holdings LLC, a limited liability company.1 This entity is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, one of the largest utility companies in the United States, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol EXC.3 The "PEPCO HOLDINGS" trademark is registered to Pepco Holdings LLC.1
Pepco Holdings LLC functions as the direct parent holding company for three main utility operating companies:
Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco): This is the electric utility serving customers in Washington D.C. and suburban Maryland.6
Delmarva Power & Light Company (Delmarva Power): This utility provides electric service to customers in Delaware and eastern Maryland, and also delivers natural gas in northern Delaware.6
Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE): This electric utility serves customers in southern New Jersey.6
Additionally, Exelon Corporation operates Exelon Business Services Company, a shared corporate services unit.9 This unit likely provides a range of centralized support functions, potentially including aspects of IT, finance, human resources, and procurement, to Pepco Holdings LLC and other Exelon utility subsidiaries.
This hierarchical corporate structure is fundamental for NCC Group to comprehend. Engagements may occur at the level of Pepco Holdings LLC or its individual operating companies. However, overarching strategic directives, approvals for significant capital expenditures, and the establishment of enterprise-wide standards, particularly for critical functions such as cybersecurity and major technology investments, are likely to originate from or be heavily influenced by Exelon Corporation. The Exelon Business Services Company could also be a key interface or stakeholder in the procurement and implementation of new services and technologies.
Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
The historical lineage of the organization traces back to the founding of the Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco) in 1896.6 The holding company, Pepco Holdings Inc. (the corporate predecessor to the current LLC structure), was incorporated in February 2001.3
The headquarters for Pepco Holdings LLC is located at 701 Ninth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20068, US.11 This building, also known as Edison Place, has a significant recent development: in April 2025, PHI Service Company, an affiliate of Exelon, acquired the building from Brookfield Properties for $175 million. As part of this transaction, Pepco's existing lease at the property will be terminated. A spokesperson for Pepco indicated that this purchase "reinforces our commitment to being a key anchor institution in the downtown area and ensures continued engagement with civic life, proximity to customers and local leaders, and support for local businesses and workforce development," and is also anticipated to "offer long-term savings for customers".12
The significant operational locations of Pepco Holdings LLC are defined by the service territories of its utility subsidiaries:
Pepco: Serves Washington, D.C., and the Maryland suburbs of Montgomery and Prince George's counties.6
Delmarva Power: Serves the majority of northern Delaware (providing both electricity and natural gas services) and the eastern shore of Maryland. Its territory extends north to the Pennsylvania border in both states, east to the Atlantic coast, south to include Maryland's Somerset County, and west to the Chesapeake Bay.6
Atlantic City Electric: Serves southern New Jersey.6
The long operational history suggests a complex technological landscape, likely comprising a mix of legacy systems and modern infrastructure components. Exelon's recent acquisition of the headquarters building signifies a strong, long-term strategic commitment to the Washington D.C. location, potentially paving the way for deeper operational integration or future investments in that facility. The geographically diverse operational footprint means PHI must manage its infrastructure, customer service, and regulatory compliance across multiple states and jurisdictions, adding layers of complexity to its operations and, consequently, its security requirements.
Organizational history and key milestones
The organizational history of Pepco Holdings LLC is marked by significant mergers, acquisitions, and strategic shifts that have shaped its current structure and operational focus.
Founding and Early Development: The foundational operating company, Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), was established in 1896, marking over a century of service in the nation's capital region.6
Formation of Pepco Holdings Inc.: In February 2001, Pepco Holdings Inc. was incorporated with the strategic purpose of acquiring Conectiv Power Delivery.3 This acquisition was finalized on August 1, 2002. Upon completion, both Pepco and Conectiv became wholly owned subsidiaries of Pepco Holdings Inc. Conectiv itself had been formed in 1998 as the holding company for Delmarva Power & Light Company and Atlantic City Electric Company, following the combination of these two utilities.3
Divestiture of Generation Assets: A key strategic shift occurred in April 2010 when Conectiv Energy, the subsidiary holding PHI's energy production facilities (generation assets), was sold to Calpine Corporation.3 This divestiture transformed PHI into an entity primarily focused on the transmission and distribution of energy, rather than generation.
Merger with Exelon Corporation: A landmark event was the merger with Exelon Corporation. Exelon announced its proposal to acquire Pepco Holdings, Inc. on April 30, 2014. The acquisition, valued at $6.8 billion, faced regulatory scrutiny but was ultimately approved, with the merger being completed on March 23, 2016.3 This transaction brought Pepco Holdings and its operating utilities under the umbrella of one of the nation's largest energy companies.
Sale of Virginia Service Area: In 2008, Delmarva Power sold its service area in the Virginia portion of the Delmarva Peninsula to A&N Electric Cooperative and Old Dominion Electric Cooperative for $44 million.3
Ongoing Infrastructure Modernization: Indicative of its commitment to modernizing its grid, Pepco recently achieved a significant milestone with the upgrade and energization of its Harvard substation. This substation, originally built in 1907, was modernized as part of the broader Capital Grid project, which aims to enhance the reliability of the local energy grid, support the integration of renewable energy sources, and enable economic development in the region.13
This history of mergers and acquisitions implies a complex integration process over the years. Such integration efforts often involve harmonizing disparate systems, including IT and OT infrastructure, which can present both challenges and opportunities for introducing new, standardized solutions. The strategic divestiture of generation assets means PHI's core operational risks and cybersecurity concerns are now squarely focused on the integrity and security of its vast transmission and distribution networks, grid control systems, and customer data systems. The ongoing modernization efforts, exemplified by the Harvard Substation upgrade, represent prime opportunities for embedding advanced OT security measures from the design phase or during upgrade cycles.
Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available)
Pepco Holdings LLC and its operating utilities are firmly situated within the Electric Utility sector, with a primary focus on energy transmission and distribution.3
Primary Business Activities: The core activities involve the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity to a diverse customer base including residential, commercial, and industrial users. Through its subsidiary Delmarva Power, PHI is also engaged in the regulated distribution of natural gas in northern Delaware.6 These activities encompass the operation and maintenance of the extensive energy grid infrastructure, provision of customer care and billing services, and offering various energy-related services and programs.3
NAICS Code: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for Pepco Holdings' primary operations is 22 - Utilities.11
SIC Code: The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code most relevant to Pepco's core electric service business is 4911 - Electric Services. This code is explicitly mentioned in relation to Commonwealth Edison, an Exelon sister utility, and is directly applicable to the operations of Pepco, Delmarva Power, and Atlantic City Electric.14
Operating within NAICS code 22 and SIC code 4911 signifies that Pepco Holdings functions as a critical infrastructure provider, essential for the economic activity and public welfare of the regions it serves. This classification brings with it a high degree of regulatory oversight from federal bodies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state-level Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) or Public Service Commissions (PSCs). These regulatory obligations include adherence to specific industry standards for reliability and cybersecurity, most notably the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) standards for entities operating elements of the Bulk Electric System. Understanding these regulatory drivers is crucial for NCC Group, as compliance requirements often dictate cybersecurity priorities and investment cycles within utility companies.
Precise company size metrics
Assessing the scale of Pepco Holdings LLC requires examining its financial performance, workforce, and market standing, primarily through the lens of its parent company, Exelon Corporation.
Annual Revenue (Pepco Holdings LLC Segment): Financial data for the PHI segment is reported within Exelon Corporation's consolidated financial statements. According to Exelon's 10-K filing (Note 18 – Segment Information), the total operating revenues for the Pepco Holdings (PHI) segment for the past three reported fiscal years are as follows (values in millions of US dollars) 15:
2023: $7,000 million
2022: $6,700 million
2021: $6,000 million A consistent year-over-year growth in revenue for the PHI segment is evident from this data. This financial stability and growth trajectory can support ongoing operational needs and new strategic investments, including those in cybersecurity and infrastructure modernization.
Employee Count:
Pepco Holdings (historical): At the time of, or prior to, the Exelon merger in 2016, Pepco Holdings had approximately 5,592 employees.3
Pepco (utility subsidiary): An undated but relatively recent figure from the Exelon website indicates that the Pepco utility employs 1,431 individuals.6
Exelon Corporation (parent company): Exelon Corporation employs approximately 20,000 people across all its operations.5
Information Gap: A precise, consolidated current employee count specifically for Pepco Holdings LLC and its individual operating companies (Delmarva Power, Atlantic City Electric) as of the most recent reporting period (e.g., end of 2023 or 2024) is not clearly available in the provided research materials.15 This data would be valuable for understanding the scale of internal user base, training needs, and insider risk considerations.
Market Capitalization:
Pepco Holdings LLC, as a wholly-owned subsidiary, is not directly publicly traded and therefore does not have its own market capitalization.3
Its parent company, Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC), is publicly traded. While its specific market capitalization is dynamic and found through financial market data providers, it is a Fortune 200 company, indicating substantial market value.4 The status of PHI as a subsidiary of a large, publicly traded corporation like Exelon means it is subject to the financial discipline, strategic direction, and overarching compliance requirements (such as Sarbanes-Oxley, or SOX) of its parent. Major investment decisions and risk management philosophies at PHI will align with Exelon's corporate standards.
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
PHI Segment Revenue Growth: Based on the revenues above, the PHI segment experienced a revenue growth of approximately 11.67% from 2021 to 2022, and approximately 4.48% from 2022 to 2023.
Exelon Corporation Outlook: Exelon projects a 5-7% annualized operating Earnings Per Share (EPS) compounded annual growth from the 2024 baseline through 2028.20
Capital Investment: Exelon has announced plans to invest approximately $38 billion in capital expenditures over the four-year period from 2025 to 2028. This represents a 10% increase compared to its prior plan and is intended to support customer needs and grid reliability, leading to an expected rate base growth of 7.4% for Exelon.20 The positive revenue trend within the PHI segment contributes to Exelon's overall financial strength and growth narrative. The substantial capital investment planned by Exelon will undoubtedly translate into significant infrastructure projects within PHI's operating territories. These projects, focused on modernization and reliability, inherently require robust cybersecurity considerations, presenting opportunities for NCC Group's services.
Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
Pepco Holdings LLC, through its three utility operating companies, serves a substantial and diverse geographic area in the Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing major metropolitan areas and extensive suburban and rural territories.
Pepco (Potomac Electric Power Company):
Service Area: Washington, D.C., and the suburban Maryland counties of Montgomery and Prince George's.6
Customer Base: Approximately 894,000 electric customers.6
Infrastructure: Operates within a 640 square mile service territory, which includes 156 substations.6
Delmarva Power (Delmarva Power & Light Company):
Service Area: Provides electric service to customers in Delaware and eastern Maryland. It also delivers natural gas to customers in northern Delaware. The territory extends northward to the Pennsylvania border in both Delaware and Maryland, eastward to the Atlantic coastlines of both states, southward to include Somerset County in Maryland, and westward to the Chesapeake Bay.6
Customer Base: Approximately 532,000 electric customers and 136,000 natural gas customers.6
Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE):
Service Area: Southern New Jersey.6
Customer Base: More than 560,000 electric customers.9
Consolidated Pepco Holdings LLC:
Total Customer Base: Collectively, the Pepco Holdings operating utilities serve over two million customers across the Mid-Atlantic region.6
The extensive geographic footprint spanning multiple states (District of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey) and varied demographic areas (urban, suburban, rural) presents significant operational and regulatory complexity. Each state has its own Public Utility/Service Commission with specific rules and mandates. The large number of customers, coupled with critical infrastructure elements like substations, signifies a vast attack surface and numerous points of potential vulnerability that require diligent cybersecurity protection. The distinct service territories of the operating companies may also harbor unique legacy systems or operational practices that need to be considered in any enterprise-wide security strategy.
Detailed corporate structure including parent-subsidiary relationships, business units and divisions, recent restructuring initiatives, and merger and acquisition history
The corporate architecture of Pepco Holdings LLC is defined by its position within the larger Exelon Corporation and its own set of operating utility subsidiaries.
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships:
Exelon Corporation is the ultimate parent company.3
Pepco Holdings LLC is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation.
The primary operating utility subsidiaries under Pepco Holdings LLC are:
Potomac Electric Power Company (trading as Pepco).6
Delmarva Power & Light Company (trading as Delmarva Power).3

Business Units and Divisions:
The primary business units are the three distinct operating utility companies listed above. Within these utilities, operations are typically segmented into functional divisions standard for the industry, such as:
Electric Operations (Transmission, Distribution, Substation Operations)
Gas Operations (for Delmarva Power)
Customer Operations (Customer Service, Billing, Metering)
Support Services (Engineering, Planning, Project Management, IT, HR, Finance - some ofwhich may be shared or directed by PHI or Exelon Business Services). For instance, a job posting for Delmarva Power references regional Overhead and Operating departments and mentions a Project Management Group.23
Recent Restructuring Initiatives:
No major corporate-level restructuring of Pepco Holdings LLC itself has been publicly announced since its acquisition by Exelon in 2016. The fundamental structure of PHI overseeing its three operating utilities remains intact.
The acquisition of the PHI headquarters building at 701 Ninth Street NW by an Exelon affiliate in April 2025 is a significant real estate and financial transaction, but not a corporate restructuring in the traditional sense.12 It does, however, signal a deeper embedding of PHI's central operations within Exelon's asset portfolio and a long-term commitment to that location.
The operating utilities (Delmarva Power, Atlantic City Electric) are continuously involved in regulatory proceedings, such as rate cases and filings for alternative rate mechanisms (e.g., Delmarva Power's Performance Based Plan filing 25 and ACE's NGC/SBC rate reconciliations 26). These are operational and financial adjustments driven by the regulatory environment rather than fundamental corporate restructuring.
Information Gap: Details regarding any internal departmental restructuring or realignment of functions within Pepco Holdings LLC or its operating companies are not available in the provided information.
Merger and Acquisition (M&A) History:
The history of PHI is significantly shaped by M&A activity:
Formation of PHI: Pepco Holdings Inc. was formed in 2001 specifically to effect the acquisition of Conectiv Power Delivery by Potomac Electric Power Company. This was completed in August 2002.3
Conectiv's Origins: Conectiv itself was a product of a merger, formed in 1998 as the holding company for Delmarva Power & Light Company and Atlantic City Electric Company.3
Divestitures:
In 2008, Delmarva Power sold its service territory in the Virginia portion of the Delmarva Peninsula to A&N Electric Cooperative and Old Dominion Electric Cooperative.3
In April 2010, PHI divested its generation assets through the sale of Conectiv Energy to Calpine Corporation.3
Acquisition by Exelon: The most transformative M&A event was the acquisition of Pepco Holdings Inc. by Exelon Corporation. Announced in April 2014, the deal was finalized on March 23, 2016.3
The M&A history, particularly the integration into Exelon, is a critical factor. Such large-scale mergers invariably lead to extensive efforts to harmonize processes, systems (including IT and OT), and corporate cultures. This history suggests that PHI has experience with large system integration projects and may still be working through the long-term implications of aligning with Exelon's enterprise standards. The existence of Exelon Business Services Company further points to a strategy of leveraging centralized functions for efficiency and standardization, which would certainly apply to areas like IT infrastructure, cybersecurity governance, and major technology procurement.
Ownership structure
Pepco Holdings LLC's ownership is straightforward due to its position within Exelon Corporation.
Direct Ownership: Pepco Holdings LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation.3 It is not a publicly traded entity itself.
Ultimate Parent's Public Status: Exelon Corporation is a publicly traded company, listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol EXC.4
Major Shareholders of Exelon Corporation: As a publicly traded entity, Exelon Corporation has a diverse shareholder base, with significant institutional ownership. The largest institutional shareholders (as of recent filings) include prominent investment management firms such as:
Vanguard Group Inc. 27
BlackRock, Inc. 27
State Street Corp 27 (Note: Specific percentages and share counts change frequently and are best obtained from up-to-date financial data services, but the names indicate the type of major institutional holders.)
Recent Ownership Changes: There have been no recent changes in the direct ownership of Pepco Holdings LLC; it has remained a subsidiary of Exelon since the 2016 merger. Exelon Corporation itself has not undergone a change of control. The historical ticker for Pepco Holdings Inc. prior to its acquisition by Exelon was POM (NYSE) 11, but this is no longer active.
The ownership structure firmly places Pepco Holdings LLC under the strategic and financial umbrella of Exelon Corporation. Major decisions at PHI, especially those involving significant capital outlay, strategic direction, or enterprise-wide risk (such as cybersecurity), will be subject to oversight, influence, or direct approval from Exelon's corporate leadership and Board of Directors. The priorities and concerns of Exelon's major institutional shareholders can also indirectly shape Exelon's overall corporate strategy, including its approach to critical areas like infrastructure investment, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, and risk management, all of which can cascade down to influence operations and investments at Pepco Holdings.
Leadership Analysis
Understanding the leadership landscape at both Pepco Holdings LLC (PHI) and its parent, Exelon Corporation, is crucial for identifying key decision-makers, influencers, and their likely priorities relevant to NCC Group's engagement. Recent leadership changes at PHI and strategic appointments at Exelon signal an evolving environment.

Vosvick II, Vice President of Human Resources for Pepco Holdings and Exelon Utilities: This dual role indicates a significant degree of centralization or harmonization in HR strategy and services across Exelon's utility operations. Vosvick is responsible for all HR and occupational health services activities for the utilities operating in all service areas. Before this combined role, he served as VP of Human Resources for BGE and VP of Talent Management, Learning, and Organizational Development for Constellation Energy.44
The recent appointments of a new COO and CFO at Pepco Holdings, both internal promotions with deep company and Exelon experience, signify a period of transition and potential strategic review. New leaders often seek to make their mark and may be more receptive to innovative solutions that can address pressing challenges in operations and finance. This presents a window of opportunity for NCC Group to engage with value propositions tailored to their respective priorities: operational resilience and regulatory compliance for the COO, and financial justification and risk mitigation for the CFO.
Board of Directors (Exelon Corporation)
As Pepco Holdings LLC is a subsidiary, its ultimate governance and strategic oversight come from the Board of Directors of Exelon Corporation. Changes and expertise at this level can significantly influence priorities across all Exelon companies, including PHI.
A highly significant recent development is the appointment of David DeWalt to Exelon Corporation's Board of Directors, effective March 2025.11 DeWalt is a recognized cybersecurity expert. The inclusion of a dedicated cybersecurity expert on Exelon's board is a strong indicator of the increasing importance of cybersecurity risk management at the highest echelons of the corporation. This typically translates to heightened board-level scrutiny of cybersecurity posture, more rigorous questioning of management's cyber strategies, and a greater willingness to allocate resources towards mitigating cyber threats across the enterprise. This development will likely increase internal pressure on PHI's leadership to demonstrate robust and improving cybersecurity measures, particularly for its critical operational technology. This creates a more favorable environment for NCC Group to propose comprehensive security solutions.
Information Gap: Full profiles of all Exelon Board members and their specific committee assignments are not detailed in the provided snippets but are typically available on Exelon's investor relations website. Understanding these assignments (especially for Audit, Risk, or Technology committees) can reveal further avenues of influence.
IT and Security Leadership
The IT and security leadership structure appears to be a hybrid model, with significant centralization at the Exelon corporate level, complemented by IT roles within Pepco Holdings and potentially its operating companies.
Exelon Corporation - Centralized IT & Cybersecurity Leadership:
Michael Brooks, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer (CIO), Exelon Corporation: Appointed in May 2024, Brooks leads Exelon's IT organization and is a member of Exelon's Executive Committee.38 His professional history includes roles as SVP & Global CIO at LKQ Corporation, CIO & COO at GATX Corporation, and CIO for Constellation NewEnergy. He holds an MBA from American University and a BA in Economics from the University of Georgia.45 The relatively recent appointment of Michael Brooks as Exelon's CIO (May 2024) is noteworthy. New CIOs often initiate strategic reviews of IT infrastructure, vendor relationships, and ongoing projects. This period can present opportunities for new technology partners to introduce their solutions. His diverse industry background prior to his energy sector role at Constellation NewEnergy may also bring fresh perspectives to Exelon's IT strategy.
Exelon Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): This role exists at the Exelon corporate level and reports directly to the Exelon CIO (Michael Brooks). The current Exelon CISO was named to the role in 2022 and possesses approximately 25 years of information technology and cybersecurity experience, with 23 of those years in the utility industry. This CISO manages Exelon's enterprise-wide cybersecurity programs, including those for its registrants like PHI, through a centralized function known as CISS (Cybersecurity and Information Security Services). The CISO and their team regularly brief senior management of each registrant and the Exelon Board of Directors on cybersecurity matters.47 Dennis Gilbert is a former VP/CISO for Exelon Corporation.48 The centralized CISO function at Exelon is the primary locus for strategic cybersecurity decision-making that impacts Pepco Holdings. The CISO's extensive utility-specific experience is a critical factor, indicating a deep understanding of the sector's unique challenges, regulatory landscape (including NERC CIP), and the convergence of IT and OT security. Engaging this individual and their team is paramount for NCC Group.
David Bell, Director – Cyber Defense Operations at Exelon: Bell oversees critical functions including Cyber Security Operations and Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR) for Exelon, managing a significant team. His prior experience includes roles as Senior Manager in Cyber Operations Services at Exelon and, importantly, leadership positions at Pepco Holdings covering corporate cybersecurity and IT infrastructure management. He is an alumnus of the University of Delaware and a U.S. Army veteran.49 David Bell's direct past experience within Pepco Holdings' environment, coupled with his current critical cyber defense role at Exelon, makes him a highly valuable contact. He likely possesses a nuanced understanding of PHI's specific legacy systems, operational challenges, and security posture, and can be an influential voice in technical evaluations and strategic security discussions.
Pepco Holdings LLC - IT Leadership:
"K.C.", VP & CIO, Pepco Holdings, Inc.: This individual is listed in a LeadIQ employee directory with the title VP & CIO for Pepco Holdings, Inc., located in the District of Columbia.11
Information Gap: The full name and a detailed professional profile for "K.C." are not available in the provided snippets. Identifying and profiling this individual is a critical next step for targeted engagement. If PHI has its own VP & CIO, this executive would be a key stakeholder for any IT or cybersecurity initiatives within PHI. They would likely have a dual reporting structure: operationally to the PHI CEO (J. Tyler Anthony) and functionally or via a dotted line to the Exelon CIO (Michael Brooks). Their primary responsibilities would involve implementing Exelon's enterprise IT and cybersecurity strategy within the PHI context, managing PHI-specific IT operations and projects, and ensuring alignment with the business needs of Pepco, Delmarva Power, and ACE.
Matthew Lenzini, Supervisor, IT and Green IT Committee Chair, Pepco Holdings Inc.: Mentioned in a book reference.52 This information is likely outdated as the source appears to be from around 2009-2010 but indicates a historical focus on specific IT initiatives within PHI.
Kevin Warhola, Head of IT Department at Plainville Electrical Products Company (PEPCO): This reference 53 appears to be for a different company named "PEPCO" (Plainville Electrical Products Company) and not Pepco Holdings or Potomac Electric Power Company. This highlights the importance of careful differentiation.
Tony Longhurst, Head of IT at Pepco CEE: This reference 54 pertains to Pepco Central & Eastern Europe, part of the European retail entity Pepco Group N.V., and is not relevant to the US-based Pepco Holdings.
Delmarva Power - IT Leadership:
"S.M.", Chief Technology Officer, Delmarva Power: Listed in a LeadIQ employee directory.55
Information Gap: The full name and a detailed professional profile for "S.M." are not available. A CTO at the operating company level, such as Delmarva Power, would typically focus on the practical application and implementation of technology to meet the specific operational requirements and strategic goals of that utility, operating under the broader IT and technology governance of PHI and Exelon.
Atlantic City Electric - IT Leadership:
Information Gap: No specific CIO, CISO, or CTO for Atlantic City Electric is explicitly named in the provided snippets. Leadership at ACE appears to be structured around regional presidents or vice presidents who may have responsibilities shared with or reporting into Pepco Holdings.56
Security Operations, Compliance, and Risk Management Leadership:
These functions are likely managed through a matrixed structure. Strategic direction and policy for compliance and risk management would emanate from Exelon corporate (e.g., David Glockner, Executive Vice President, Compliance, Audit & Risk for Exelon Corporation 37). Security operations are centrally managed by the Exelon CISO's organization (CISS), with David Bell leading Cyber Defense Operations.47 Implementation and operational management of these functions would occur at the PHI and individual operating company levels, ensuring adherence to corporate standards and specific regulatory requirements.
Digital Transformation Leadership:
Leadership for digital transformation initiatives typically resides within the CIO's office or a dedicated innovation function. At Exelon, this would likely be driven by the Exelon CIO, Michael Brooks, in collaboration with business unit leaders. PHI's own CIO ("K.C.") would be responsible for executing these initiatives within PHI's context.
Middle Management in Relevant Departments
Information Gap: Specific names and contact details for IT infrastructure managers, security operations managers, network and systems administrators, and procurement and vendor management contacts within Pepco Holdings or its operating companies (Pepco, Delmarva Power, ACE) are not available in the provided research snippets. These middle management roles are critical for the NCC Group sales team to identify. Individuals in these positions are often the first point of contact for technical discussions, deeply understand the existing environment and its pain points, and can be significant influencers or champions for new solutions. Further research using professional networking platforms (e.g., LinkedIn Sales Navigator) and targeted discovery during initial engagements will be necessary to map out these key personnel.
Decision-Making Patterns
While specific documented approval processes are not detailed, the organizational structure and leadership roles allow for informed inferences about decision-making patterns for technology purchases, particularly for cybersecurity.
Centralized Strategic Decisions: Major strategic decisions regarding IT architecture, enterprise-wide cybersecurity policies, standards, and significant technology platform selections are likely made at the Exelon corporate level. This would involve the Exelon CIO (Michael Brooks), the Exelon CISO, and potentially Exelon's Executive Committee for substantial investments.38 The recent board appointment of David DeWalt suggests that major security investments might also receive closer board scrutiny or endorsement.11
PHI and Operating Company Influence: Pepco Holdings LLC and its operating companies (Pepco, Delmarva Power, ACE) would play a crucial role in defining specific business and operational requirements, identifying needs, and initiating budget requests. The PHI C-suite (CEO J. Tyler Anthony, COO Rodney Oddoye, CFO Morgan O'Donnell) and the PHI VP & CIO ("K.C.") would champion these requirements and ensure they align with both local operational needs and Exelon's broader strategy.
Budget Authority and Approval Thresholds: Budgets are likely developed at the operating company and PHI levels, then consolidated and subjected to approval within Exelon's comprehensive financial planning process. Minor expenditures might be approved within PHI, but significant capital investments or new enterprise-wide service contracts would almost certainly require approval from Exelon corporate, involving the Exelon CFO (Jeanne Jones 20) and other relevant executives. The new PHI CFO, Morgan O'Donnell, will be a key figure in managing PHI's budget and justifying expenditures to Exelon.30
Approval Process for Technology Purchases: A typical approval process would likely involve:
Needs Identification: By operational teams or IT/security staff at the OpCo or PHI level.
Technical Evaluation: Review by relevant IT and cybersecurity teams within PHI and/or Exelon's CISS to ensure technical feasibility, alignment with enterprise architecture, and security standards.
Business Case Development: Justification of the investment, including ROI, risk reduction, and alignment with strategic objectives. This would be championed by PHI leadership.
Financial Approval: Review and approval by PHI's CFO, followed by Exelon financial authorities for larger sums.
Procurement and Legal Review: Managed by procurement departments (potentially centralized under Exelon Business Services) and legal teams to finalize contracts. For any solutions impacting the Bulk Electric System, adherence to NERC CIP standards and potential review by compliance teams would be integral to the approval process.
Information Gap: Specific dollar thresholds for budget authorities at different levels (OpCo, PHI, Exelon) and detailed flowcharts of the approval process for technology purchases are not publicly available.

Procurement Patterns:
Given Exelon's size and the existence of Exelon Business Services Company 9, procurement for major solutions is likely centralized to leverage economies of scale and ensure standardization.
Decisions would involve technical evaluation by CISS/IT teams, business justification, and financial approval, likely following a formal RFP process for significant purchases.
Vendor Consolidation Efforts: Large organizations often periodically review their vendor portfolios to consolidate and reduce complexity, which can create opportunities for comprehensive solution providers.
Information Gap: No specific vendor consolidation efforts are mentioned.
Multi-Year Agreements Announced: Not publicly detailed for security vendors.
The lack of specific vendor information in the public domain is typical for utilities. NCC Group will need to leverage its own market intelligence and discovery processes during engagement to map out PHI's current security vendor ecosystem. Identifying key technology partners (e.g., primary OT system vendors) can provide clues about potential existing security layers or integration points. The centralized procurement model at Exelon suggests that any significant sales effort will need to navigate corporate procurement processes and potentially compete in formal RFPs.
Technical Pain Points and Challenges
Pepco Holdings, like other utilities, faces a range of technical and security-specific challenges. While explicit admissions of "pain points" are rare in public statements, industry trends, regulatory pressures, and the nature of their infrastructure allow for informed inferences.
Publicly acknowledged technical issues
System Performance Problems/Reliability Issues:
While PHI/Exelon aims for top-quartile reliability 9, the very nature of an aging grid means that ensuring consistent performance and minimizing outages is an ongoing challenge. The Capital Grid project and Harvard Substation upgrade 13 are direct responses to the need to improve reliability in specific areas.
Public outcry over high energy bills in Delmarva Power's territory was linked to regional energy supply and demand imbalances, which can stress the delivery system.57
Integration Challenges:
The history of mergers (Pepco with Conectiv, then PHI with Exelon 3) often leads to a heterogeneous technology environment with systems from different eras and vendors, making integration complex.
Integrating new smart grid technologies and DERs with existing legacy infrastructure is a significant technical hurdle for all utilities.
Scalability Concerns:
Exelon anticipates a substantial increase in demand from large load customers (17+ GW pipeline 59), requiring the T&D infrastructure to scale significantly. This has implications for network capacity, substation capabilities, and the control systems managing them.
Compatibility Problems: Arise when integrating new technologies with older systems that may use proprietary protocols or lack modern interface capabilities.
Security-specific challenges
Securing Legacy OT Systems: Many components of the energy grid rely on OT systems that may be decades old, lacking built-in security features, and difficult to patch without risking operational disruption. This is a pervasive challenge in the utility sector.
IT/OT Convergence Risks: As IT and OT systems become more interconnected to enable data analytics and remote operations, the risk of IT-based threats propagating to the OT environment increases. Securely managing these convergence points is critical.
Expanding Attack Surface: The proliferation of IoT devices (smart meters, sensors) and increased connectivity for grid modernization initiatives significantly expands the potential attack surface.
Third-Party and Supply Chain Risks: Reliance on a wide range of hardware and software vendors, as well as service providers, introduces risks related to vulnerabilities in third-party products or security lapses by contractors.
Threat Actor Sophistication: Critical infrastructure is targeted by sophisticated threat actors, including nation-states and well-funded criminal groups, who develop advanced tools and techniques.
Vulnerability Management in OT: Patching and vulnerability remediation in OT environments are far more complex than in IT, often requiring planned outages or extensive testing to avoid impacting operations.
Security Skills Gaps: Finding and retaining cybersecurity professionals with expertise in OT environments and industrial control systems is a challenge for many industries, including utilities.
Analysis: While not explicitly stated for PHI in the snippets, this is a widely acknowledged industry problem.
Resource Constraints: While Exelon is a large company, cybersecurity budgets still compete with other priorities. Demonstrating value and ROI for security investments is crucial.
Security Visibility Challenges: Gaining comprehensive visibility into traffic and device behavior across sprawling and often segmented OT networks can be difficult, hindering effective threat detection and response.
Compliance Struggles (NERC CIP): Maintaining continuous compliance with NERC CIP standards is a complex and resource-intensive undertaking, requiring meticulous documentation, regular audits, and ongoing security controls.
Industry-specific technical challenges
Interoperability of Grid Technologies: Ensuring that new smart grid components and DERs from different vendors can interoperate effectively and securely.
Data Management and Analytics for Grid Operations: Handling the massive volumes of data generated by smart grid devices and using it effectively for improved grid management, predictive maintenance, and outage prevention, all while ensuring data security and privacy.
Resilience to Extreme Weather and Physical Threats: Alongside cyber threats, utilities must ensure their infrastructure is resilient to physical threats, including extreme weather events, which can have overlapping impacts with cyber incidents (e.g., complicating restoration efforts).
Executive statements on challenges
While direct admissions of "pain points" are rare, executive statements often allude to challenges by highlighting strategic priorities to address them. For example:
J. Tyler Anthony's (PHI CEO) focus on "reliable and excellent service" 6 implies that maintaining reliability is an ongoing effort and a core challenge.
Exelon's $38 billion CAPEX plan aimed at "customer needs and grid reliability" 20 inherently acknowledges that the current grid requires significant investment to meet these needs and maintain reliability.
The discussion around Delmarva Power's rate increases due to "region having an imbalance between available energy and increased demand" 57 points to broader systemic challenges impacting utility operations.
The technical and security challenges faced by Pepco Holdings are typical of large, regulated utilities operating critical infrastructure. These include managing a mix of legacy and modern systems, securing an expanding and converging IT/OT landscape, complying with stringent regulations, and defending against sophisticated cyber threats. These challenges directly translate into needs that NCC Group and Dragos can address, particularly in the OT security domain.
Digital Footprint Analysis
Analyzing Pepco Holdings' digital footprint provides insights into its public-facing technologies, online presence, and potential areas of exposure. This analysis is based on publicly accessible information and inferences.
Online technical presence
Technology-Focused Job Postings (Exelon/PHI): Reviewing career pages for Exelon and its subsidiaries (Pepco, Delmarva Power, ACE) would reveal the types of technical skills and technologies they are actively seeking. Postings for roles in IT operations, network engineering, cybersecurity (IT and OT), SCADA engineering, data analytics, and cloud engineering would indicate current technology focus areas and potential skill gaps they are trying to fill.
Information Gap: Specific job posting analysis was not part of the provided snippets but is a standard OSINT technique.
GitHub Repositories and Contributions: Unlikely for a utility like PHI to have significant public GitHub repositories related to its core operational systems. Any presence would likely be from individual employees or non-critical projects.
Technical Blog Posts or Whitepapers: Exelon or PHI might publish high-level information on technology initiatives or innovation, but detailed technical blogs are uncommon for utilities.
Developer Community Participation: Similar to GitHub, direct participation in open developer communities for core systems is unlikely.
Technology Stack Mentions in Careers Pages/Company Descriptions:
LeadIQ mentions Atlassian, Articulate Storyline, Mustache, Moment.js, jQuery, UNIX, Microsoft Exchange, and Timesheets in relation to Pepco Holdings' tech stack.11 These suggest a mix of web technologies, development tools, and standard enterprise IT components.
Analysis: The mention of UNIX aligns with common operating systems in some legacy utility environments or specialized server applications. The other tools are standard for web development, project management, and corporate IT.
Digital asset inventory (Public-Facing)
Domains and Subdomains:
Primary domains include pepco.com, delmarva.com, atlanticcityelectric.com, and exeloncorp.com.
Numerous subdomains would exist for customer portals, outage maps, investor relations, newsrooms, etc..62
Analysis: Each public-facing domain and subdomain is a potential attack vector. Security of web applications, DNS, and SSL/TLS certificates is crucial.
IP Ranges and Network Blocks: Assigned to Exelon/PHI, discoverable through public IP lookup tools.
Public-Facing Applications:
Customer self-service portals (for billing, account management, outage reporting).
Mobile applications for customers (iOS and Android).
Outage maps.
Online new service request forms.
Mobile Applications: Pepco, Delmarva Power, and Atlantic City Electric each have mobile apps for customers to manage accounts, view outages, and pay bills.
Analysis: Mobile apps introduce their own set of vulnerabilities (insecure storage, insecure communication, code vulnerabilities) that need to be managed.
API Endpoints: Likely exist for mobile app functionality, customer portal integrations, and potentially for third-party service integrations (e.g., smart home devices, energy management platforms).
Analysis: APIs are a common target for attackers if not properly secured (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation).
Technology usage patterns (Web-based)
Based on common utility practices and the limited mentions 11:
