A notable asset is their "Production Power," embodied by the world's largest straddle carrier fleet, which is instrumental in supporting high-volume operations. The company demonstrates an enduring commitment to "Productivity and Service" through its focus on the high-speed movement of goods. Furthermore, Maher actively fosters "Innovation" by developing creative solutions to common operational challenges and strategically utilizes "On Dock Rail" facilities for swift container transfers between vessels and rail networks.1 The company's business activities are formally categorized under NAICS Code 488310 (Port and Harbor Operations) and SIC Code 4491 (Marine Cargo Handling), denoting their specialized role in dock and pier operations.4 To enhance client interaction, Maher also offers a "Customer Service Package" that addresses demurrage payments and inquiries related to containers, bookings, and gate operations.1
The operational scale and strategic position of Maher Terminals underscore its critical role within global and regional supply chains. The company's self-identification as a "vital link" 1, coupled with impressive 2023 operational metrics—nearly 2.0 million containers handled, 40,000 containers moved weekly, and 8,500 trucks processed daily—highlights its immense importance.5 Given that the Port of New York and New Jersey, where Maher is situated, is the largest on the East Coast and handles over $200 billion worth of cargo annually 6, any disruption at Maher could trigger significant, cascading economic ripple effects. This positions Maher Terminals as a critical infrastructure target, suggesting that robust cybersecurity and operational resilience are not merely business advantages but national economic imperatives. Value propositions centered on maintaining operational continuity and mitigating systemic risk are therefore likely to resonate strongly with Maher's executive leadership and potentially with regulatory bodies.
Maher Terminals operates North America's largest marine container terminal, strategically located within the Port of New York and New Jersey.1 This facility is designed to provide extensive container throughput capacity, meeting and exceeding the current and future operational demands of its ocean carrier customers.1 In 2023, the terminal handled approximately 800 vessel calls and processed an average of 48 trains per week, in addition to maintaining a physical inventory of over 40,000 containers.5 Maher is also a significant employer in the Port of New York and New Jersey, reporting over 1,500 dedicated professionals in 2023, comprising 1,400 union members and 137 management staff.5 Historical records indicate up to 1,200 daily employees in 2020.7 The company previously operated a container terminal in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada, which was sold in 2015.8
The sheer volume and complexity of Maher's operations, involving millions of TEUs, thousands of daily truck movements, and hundreds of vessel calls 5, inherently necessitate highly efficient, reliable, and resilient systems. Even minor operational inefficiencies or security vulnerabilities could result in substantial financial losses, reputational damage, and widespread supply chain disruptions. The company's ownership of the "world's largest straddle carrier fleet," comprising over 270 Kalmar machines 1, further underscores the intricate nature and criticality of its operational technology (OT) environment. This scale implies a profound reliance on sophisticated automated systems and extensive data management, making Maher an ideal candidate for advanced cybersecurity solutions, IT/OT convergence strategies, and comprehensive digital transformation services. Maher's commitment to high-volume operations and efficiency suggests a continuous drive for technological advancement. Accordingly, positioning security solutions not just as protective measures but as enablers for future innovations and expansions, ensuring that growth is underpinned by robust security, would be a compelling approach.
Maher Terminals LLC's primary operational footprint is concentrated in Port Elizabeth, NJ 07201, a strategically vital location within the broader Port of New York and New Jersey complex.11 Key facilities include the Maher Container Terminal at Building 1210, Corbin Street; the Millennium Marine Rail at 2380 Tripoli Street & Formosa Street; and the Maher Empty Depot at Columbia Container Services, located at 1100 Polaris St..11 The concentration of Maher's entire operational infrastructure within a single, critical geographical area means that any localized disruption—be it from a cyberattack, natural disaster, or physical incident—could have a disproportionately severe impact on their entire business. This centralization significantly increases the importance of robust local security measures, comprehensive disaster recovery planning, and resilient business continuity strategies. Given the Port of New York and New Jersey's status as a nationally significant economic gateway 6, the criticality of Maher's operations is further amplified. This geographical concentration presents an opportunity to tailor solutions to the specific risks and regulatory environment of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Emphasizing geographically focused resilience and rapid incident response capabilities, potentially through local presence or partnerships, could be a key differentiator.
Maher Terminals LLC, originally a family-owned business founded by Michael Maher after World War II, underwent a significant ownership transition in July 2007. At that time, Brian and Basil Maher sold the company to RREEF Infrastructure, the asset management division of Deutsche Bank.8 Subsequently, in 2016, Deutsche Bank divested Maher Terminals USA, LLC (specifically the Port Elizabeth, NJ terminal) to Macquarie Infrastructure Partners III (MIP III), a fund managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA).9 Macquarie Asset Management continues to hold investments in Maher Terminals.17
Maher Terminals' estimated annual revenue is approximately $152.4 million 3, with some sources indicating a broader range of $50 million to $200 million.18 It is important to note that the company's 2023 Sustainability Report does not explicitly state annual revenue figures.5 The 2007 acquisition by RREEF Infrastructure involved a total project value of $1.266.7 billion, backed by $36.7 million in equity and $1.23 billion in senior debt.13 There is a noticeable discrepancy in reported employee counts across various sources. Growjo.com indicates 460 employees with a 3% growth in the prior year 3, while Salary.com suggests a range of 3,000-7,500 employees.18 Maher's own 2023 Sustainability Report, however, provides a more precise figure of over 1,500 dedicated professionals, comprising 1,400 union members and 137 management staff.5 A 2020 document also cited up to 1,200 employees daily.7 The figures from the official sustainability report are likely the most accurate representation of their operational workforce.
The ownership of Maher Terminals by Macquarie Infrastructure Partners III 9 indicates a strategic emphasis on maximizing asset value and operational efficiency. Infrastructure funds typically aim for long-term value creation through optimized performance, eventually leading to profitable divestment. The prior divestment by Deutsche Bank, which had incurred substantial losses on its investment 19, further highlights the historical and ongoing imperative for operational and financial optimization. This suggests that Maher's leadership is highly receptive to solutions that demonstrate clear, measurable returns on investment in terms of efficiency gains, risk reduction, and operational continuity, thereby directly contributing to their financial health and asset valuation. Consequently, proposals should be framed not merely as technical solutions but as strategic business investments. Emphasizing how cybersecurity directly contributes to operational uptime, reduces financial exposure from incidents, ensures regulatory compliance, and enhances overall asset value will be crucial for engaging with Maher's private equity owners and executive team.
The observed discrepancy in reported employee counts, with the 2023 Sustainability Report's figure of over 1,500 (1,400 union, 137 management) appearing to be the most reliable 5, is an important consideration. This large, predominantly unionized workforce introduces unique dynamics for security awareness, training, and incident response. The human element represents a significant factor in their overall operational security posture. Therefore, any cybersecurity strategy for Maher must account for a large, diverse workforce. This presents an opportunity to offer comprehensive, tailored security awareness and training programs that are sensitive to the operational context and potentially unionized environment, fostering a robust "human firewall" as a critical security layer.

Potential Weakness: May face resource constraints, skills gaps in advanced areas (e.g., AI-driven attacks, zero-day exploits), and limited bandwidth for proactive security enhancements beyond daily operations.5 They might also struggle with the rapid pace of evolving threats without external specialized support.
Competitive Playbook for NCC Group
Lead with OT/ICS Security: Given Maher's extensive operational technology and the critical nature of port infrastructure, highlight NCC Group's specialized expertise in securing industrial control systems. Reference the increasing threats to OT environments in the maritime sector.65
Connect Security to Business Outcomes: Directly link NCC Group's services to Maher's strategic priorities: operational uptime, efficiency, sustainability goals, and financial stability. For example, explain how securing electric straddle carriers protects their green investments and avoids costly disruptions.
Emphasize Proactive Risk Management: Position NCC Group as a partner that helps Maher move beyond reactive defense to proactive threat identification and mitigation, reducing overall risk exposure and compliance burdens. Highlight services like penetration testing, red teaming, and vulnerability management.
Highlight Incident Response & Resiliency: Stress the importance of a robust cyber resiliency program and offer advanced incident response services, including tabletop exercises and crisis management, to ensure Maher can quickly recover from any major cyber incident.
Address Workforce & Skills Gaps: Propose tailored security awareness training and managed security services to augment Maher's internal capabilities, allowing their team to focus on core operations while leveraging NCC Group's specialized expertise.
Showcase Industry Recognition & Trust: Leverage NCC Group's reputation and any relevant industry certifications or client success stories in critical infrastructure or maritime sectors to build credibility and trust.
Conclusions
Maher Terminals LLC stands as a critical pillar in global logistics, operating North America's largest marine container terminal within the strategically vital Port of New York and New Jersey. The company's significant operational scale, handling millions of containers annually and thousands of daily truck movements, underscores its immense importance to regional and international supply chains. This high volume of activity necessitates highly efficient, reliable, and resilient systems, positioning Maher as a critical infrastructure entity where any disruption could have severe economic and reputational consequences.
Under the ownership of Macquarie Infrastructure Partners III, Maher Terminals is driven by a focus on maximizing asset value and operational efficiency. This financial imperative, coupled with an ambitious Net-Zero by 2040 sustainability goal, translates into significant ongoing investments in advanced technologies, particularly within its operational technology (OT) environment. The executive leadership, characterized by long-tenured industry veterans and forward-thinking functional heads, demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation, safety, and corporate social responsibility.
Despite its robust infrastructure and proactive security measures, Maher Terminals faces a dynamic threat landscape common to critical maritime infrastructure. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats, including state-sponsored attacks and ransomware targeting OT systems, alongside challenges related to technical debt, resource constraints, and the need for comprehensive visibility, presents continuous security imperatives.
For NCC Group, the strategic implications are clear:
Strategic Partnership: Engage Maher Terminals not merely as a vendor but as a strategic partner capable of safeguarding their critical operations and enabling their long-term strategic initiatives, particularly in sustainability and digital transformation.
Tailored Value Propositions: Custom-design proposals that directly address the specific priorities of Maher's executive leadership, linking advanced cybersecurity solutions to tangible business outcomes such as operational continuity, financial resilience, and the protection of green technology investments.
OT/ICS Specialization: Emphasize deep expertise in Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security, recognizing the unique vulnerabilities and critical importance of these systems within a port environment. This specialized focus will differentiate NCC Group from generalist cybersecurity providers.
Holistic Risk Management: Offer a comprehensive suite of services that spans proactive risk assessment, advanced incident response, secure system design, and ongoing managed security services to address Maher's full spectrum of IT, OT, and supply chain security needs.
Human Element Integration: Propose enhanced security awareness and training programs tailored to Maher's large, diverse workforce, recognizing the human element as a critical component of their overall security posture.
By aligning its offerings with Maher Terminals' core values of efficiency, safety, innovation, and sustainability, and by demonstrating a profound understanding of the complex challenges inherent in critical maritime infrastructure, NCC Group can establish a strong, enduring partnership that contributes significantly to Maher's continued success and resilience.
