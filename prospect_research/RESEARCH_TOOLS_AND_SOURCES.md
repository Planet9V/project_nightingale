- Searching for non-public information
- Perfect financial data for private companies
- Complete technology stack details
- Historical data beyond 2-3 years

### ‚úÖ Quality Markers

Your research is "good enough" when you can answer:
1. Who runs the company?
2. What's their business model?
3. Who owns IT/Security decisions?
4. What major initiatives are underway?
5. What incidents/issues have they faced?

If you have these five, move to the next prospect.

### üìù Gap Documentation

When information isn't available, note it clearly:

```markdown
## Research Gaps
- CISO name not found (role may not exist or is not public)
- Private company - no detailed financials available
- OT environment unclear - no public information
- Security vendors unknown - no case studies found
```

This is more valuable than spending hours hunting for information that may not exist publicly.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Research Guidelines

**Per Prospect Target:**
- Quick scan for basics
- Fill priority gaps
- Document findings
- Note missing information

**Key Principle:** Stop when you have diminishing returns. Document what's missing and move on.

**Remember:** 80% coverage on all prospects beats 100% coverage on half.
