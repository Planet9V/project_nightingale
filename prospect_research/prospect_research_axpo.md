Go-to-Market Analysis: Axpo U.S. LLC - Organization Profile & Leadership
Executive Summary
Axpo U.S. LLC serves as the North American arm of the Swiss-based Axpo Group, a prominent international energy producer and trader. Established formally in 2015-2016 1, Axpo U.S. focuses on energy trading, Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) origination, and sophisticated risk management solutions within key U.S. energy markets.3 As a subsidiary of Axpo Solutions AG, the trading and sales division of Axpo Holding AG, Axpo U.S. leverages global expertise and substantial financial backing while cultivating a local presence in New York and Houston.1 This structure allows it to operate with the agility of a specialized entity while benefiting from the resources and stability of its parent, which is wholly owned by Swiss cantons.6
The U.S. operations are spearheaded by Managing Director Kamal Khoury, who brings relevant international experience from Axpo's UK renewables business.7 While local leadership drives U.S. activities, strategic oversight, particularly for significant technology and security investments, involves key executives at the Axpo Group level, including the Head of Trading & Sales, the Group COO (responsible for Technology Management and Procurement), and the Group CISO.9
Recent developments underscore Axpo U.S.'s growing traction, notably a long-term PPA announced in April 2025 with Danfoss to supply renewable energy to numerous U.S. facilities.11 This achievement, coupled with Axpo Group's strategic focus on expanding its international renewables portfolio and its recent launch of an Operational Technology (OT) Security Operations Center (SOC) in Europe 12, signals potential avenues and priorities for Axpo U.S. The company's competitive positioning in the U.S. relies on its parent's financial strength, global trading acumen, and specialized renewables expertise, allowing it to target sophisticated clients and complex energy needs. Understanding this multi-layered context is crucial for effectively engaging Axpo U.S.
Organizational Profile (Axpo U.S. LLC)
This section details the foundational elements of Axpo U.S. LLC, including its legal structure, history, operational scope, and relationship within the broader Axpo Group.
1.1 Full legal name and corporate structure
The full legal name of the entity is AXPO U.S. LLC.1 It is structured as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) and is registered in the State of Delaware, with the entity creation date listed as July 20, 2015.1 The choice of an LLC structure is common for U.S. subsidiaries of international corporations, offering liability protection for the parent company and operational flexibility. Delaware is a frequently chosen jurisdiction due to its well-established corporate legal framework. This formal registration indicates a structured approach to Axpo's U.S. operations.
1.2 Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
While the legal entity was created on July 20, 2015 1, and its initial Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) registration occurred on February 18, 2016 1, Axpo communications often cite the founding or establishment of Axpo U.S. as 2016.2 This timeline marks a deliberate and relatively recent expansion into the U.S. energy market.
The headquarters of Axpo U.S. LLC is located at:
575 Fifth Avenue, Suite 2801, New York, NY 10017.1
A significant operational office is maintained at:
440 Louisiana Street, Suite 1818, Houston, TX 77002.5
The New York headquarters positions Axpo U.S. within a primary global financial and commercial center, advantageous for its energy trading and financial operations. The Houston office provides a strategic presence in the epicenter of the U.S. energy industry, crucial for engaging with oil, gas, and renewable energy sectors. This dual-office strategy allows Axpo U.S. to address both the financial complexities of energy trading from New York and the physical market dynamics and operational aspects from Houston, particularly concerning markets like ERCOT in Texas.
1.3 Organizational history and key milestones
Axpo U.S. LLC was established to extend Axpo Group's reach into the North American energy markets. Key milestones since its formation include:
January 1, 2016: Jeremy Wodakow was appointed as the first Managing Director, marking the formal commencement of U.S. business activities.15
2020: Axpo U.S. participated in a complex hedging structure for the Long Ridge gas-fired power project in Ohio, which was recognized as the "Conventional Power Deal of the Year" by Power Finance & Risk magazine.15 This early success indicated its capability in sophisticated financial structuring within the U.S. power sector.
April 22, 2025: Axpo U.S. announced a significant corporate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Danfoss. Under this agreement, Axpo U.S. will supply renewable energy sourced from the Shakes Solar farm in Texas (developed by Cypress Creek Renewables) to power all 24 Danfoss factories and 36 locations in the United States through 2032.11
This progression from market entry to executing substantial, multi-year PPAs with major industrial clients within approximately a decade demonstrates Axpo U.S.'s successful establishment and growing capabilities in the competitive U.S. renewables and energy solutions market.
1.4 Industry classification and primary business activities
Axpo U.S. LLC's primary business activities center on delivering energy supply and risk management solutions to a diverse clientele, including consumers, producers, and retailers of electricity and natural gas. Key activities include Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) origination and comprehensive energy trading services.3 These activities are an extension of its parent, Axpo Group, which is broadly involved in energy production, trading, and sales on an international scale.16
Third-party data aggregators have presented conflicting and evidently incorrect industry classifications for the parent Axpo Group, such as SIC code 3081 (Unsupported Plastics Film and Sheet) and NAICS code 541810 (Advertising Agencies).18 These classifications do not align with the company's clear focus on the energy sector.
Analysis: Based on Axpo U.S. LLC's stated operations, more pertinent NAICS codes would include:
NAICS 523130 (Commodity Contracts Dealing): This code is highly relevant given Axpo U.S.'s engagement in energy commodity trading and the provision of financial risk management solutions.
NAICS 221121 (Electric Bulk Power Transmission and Control): This may apply if their trading activities involve direct participation in wholesale electricity market operations within RTOs/ISOs.
For its PPA origination activities, Axpo U.S. acts as an offtaker or intermediary for power generated under specific renewable energy generation codes, such as NAICS 221114 (Solar Electric Power Generation) and NAICS 221115 (Wind Electric Power Generation).19
The misclassification by some data providers underscores the specialized nature of international energy service companies like Axpo U.S. It operates not as a traditional utility or manufacturer but as a sophisticated participant in energy markets, focusing on financial instruments, risk mitigation, and structuring long-term energy supply. This distinction is important for understanding the specific operational and security needs of Axpo U.S., which are more aligned with trading platforms, data integrity, and risk management systems.
1.5 Precise company size metrics
Specific financial metrics for Axpo U.S. LLC are not publicly disclosed separately from its parent entities. However, the financial strength of Axpo Group and Axpo Solutions AG provides context for the resources available to the U.S. subsidiary.
Annual Revenue:
Axpo Holding AG (Ultimate Parent): For the 2022/23 financial year, total income was CHF 10.451 billion, with an adjusted EBIT of CHF 2.689 billion.21 For the 2023/24 financial year, Axpo Group reported total income of CHF 7.635 billion and an adjusted EBIT of CHF 1.848 billion.22 For the first half of the 2024/2025 financial year, Axpo Group's total income was CHF 4.046 billion with an adjusted EBIT of CHF 847 million.23
Axpo Solutions AG (Direct Parent): For the 2023/24 financial year, revenue was CHF 5.7222 billion, with an EBIT of CHF 945.9 million. This was a decrease from the 2022/23 revenue of CHF 6.4215 billion and EBIT of CHF 1.9253 billion.24
Axpo U.S. LLC: Specific revenue figures are not publicly available. (Information Gap)
Employee Count:
Axpo Group: Employs "more than 7,000" individuals globally.3 As of March 31, 2025, the specific count was 7,312 employees.23 Earlier figures around 4,200 employees 5 appear outdated or pertain to a specific segment of the Group.
Axpo U.S. LLC: The specific number of employees for the U.S. entity is not publicly available and is likely a specialized team. (Information Gap)
Market Capitalization: Axpo Holding AG is not a publicly traded company; it is owned by the cantons and cantonal utilities of northeastern Switzerland.6 Thus, market capitalization is not applicable.
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory: Axpo Group has demonstrated robust revenues, albeit with volatility characteristic of the energy sector. The Group is pursuing significant investments in renewable energy and international expansion.21 While the H1 2024/25 results showed a decrease in EBIT compared to an exceptionally strong prior year, they still reflect solid performance.23 Axpo Solutions AG also recorded substantial revenues, though with a noted decrease in EBIT for the 2023/24 period compared to the previous year.24
The financial stability and strategic direction of its parent companies are critical indicators of Axpo U.S.'s operational capacity and long-term commitment to the U.S. market. The Group's emphasis on growing its renewables portfolio and international trading activities directly supports the mandate of Axpo U.S. This backing provides Axpo U.S. with a considerable competitive edge in terms of credibility, the ability to undertake large-scale deals like the Danfoss PPA, and resilience against market fluctuations when compared to smaller, independent U.S. energy trading firms.
1.6 Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
Axpo U.S. LLC operates from its headquarters in New York, NY, and a significant operational office in Houston, TX.1 Its operational reach within the U.S. energy markets includes activity in ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), as evidenced by the Danfoss PPA sourcing energy from a Texas solar farm 11, and PJM Interconnection, indicated by transaction data with Powervine Energy at the ADHUB (a PJM trading hub) in Q4 2024.26 While direct evidence for MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) activity is less prominent in the available information, its inclusion in some summaries 14 suggests it may also be a market of interest.
The parent, Axpo Group, has an extensive international presence, operating in over 30 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia.7 This global network provides Axpo U.S. with a broad perspective on energy markets and access to international expertise. The strategic targeting by Axpo U.S. of some of the largest and most dynamic U.S. wholesale electricity markets (ERCOT and PJM) signifies an ambition to play a meaningful role in regions characterized by high trading volumes and significant renewable energy integration.
1.7 Detailed corporate structure
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships:
AXPO U.S. LLC is a direct subsidiary of Axpo Solutions AG.1
Axpo Solutions AG, in turn, is a wholly-owned (100%) subsidiary of Axpo Holding AG.6
Axpo Holding AG functions as the ultimate parent company of the entire group.1
Business Units and Divisions:
The Axpo Group is organized into several key Business Areas:
Generation & Distribution: Responsible for power plant operations (nuclear, hydro, gas, new energies) and distribution grids.28
Trading & Sales: Managed by Axpo Solutions AG, this division handles energy trading, origination, and customer solutions internationally. Axpo U.S. LLC operates within this business area.6
CKW (Centralschweizerische Kraftwerke AG): A leading energy services provider in Central Switzerland, operating largely as a utility.28
Group Functions/Services (Axpo Services AG): Bundles core management and service functions for the Group, including the offices of the CEO, COO, and CFO.28
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: No specific restructuring initiatives directly impacting Axpo U.S. LLC have been noted in the available information. The Axpo Group continuously optimizes its portfolio, such as the divestment of its stake in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP).21
Merger and Acquisition History:
Axpo Group has a history of strategic acquisitions in Europe to enhance its renewables capabilities, including Volkswind GmbH (wind energy, 2015) and Urbasolar SAS (solar energy, 2019).6 More recently, Axpo acquired LINIA, a Swiss software company, in April 2024.32 There is no information available regarding M&A activity undertaken directly by Axpo U.S. LLC.
Axpo U.S. LLC's placement within Axpo Solutions AG (the Trading & Sales arm) clearly indicates its primary role: to deploy the Group's sophisticated energy trading, risk management, and PPA origination capabilities within the North American market. This focus is more on market participation and structuring energy solutions rather than on the direct development or ownership of physical generation assets in the U.S., a strategy that differs from Axpo Group's asset development in Europe.
1.8 Ownership structure
Axpo Holding AG, the ultimate parent of Axpo U.S. LLC, is not publicly traded on any stock exchange. It is 100% owned by the cantons (states) of Northeastern Switzerland and their respective cantonal utility companies.6 This public (cantonal) ownership structure has remained stable, with no recent changes noted.
This unique ownership model provides the Axpo Group, and by extension Axpo U.S., with a high degree of financial stability, a long-term investment horizon, and a strong credit profile. These attributes are particularly advantageous in the energy sector for securing large, long-duration contracts such as PPAs and for maintaining credibility as a counterparty in volatile trading markets. This differentiates Axpo from privately-held or stock-exchange-listed competitors who may be more susceptible to short-term market pressures and shareholder demands.

Information Gaps: Full professional profile, including educational background, career history, tenure, and other public engagements.
Relevant Axpo Group C-Suite (Axpo Holding AG / Axpo Solutions AG):
The leadership of Axpo U.S. operates within the broader strategic framework set by Axpo Group. Key Group executives likely to influence or approve major decisions impacting Axpo U.S., especially concerning technology, security, and significant investments, include:
Domenico De Luca, Head Business Area Trading & Sales, Axpo Solutions AG
A member of the Axpo Group Executive Board, Mr. De Luca (M.Sc., Swiss and Italian national) oversees the global Trading & Sales division, into which Axpo U.S. LLC reports.9 He is instrumental in setting the overarching strategy for this business area and has publicly commented on Axpo's PPA strategy and market potential.37 Significant strategic initiatives or investments related to U.S. trading operations would likely fall under his purview for approval.
Christoph Brand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Axpo Group
As CEO of Axpo Group since May 2020, Mr. Brand drives the overall corporate vision and strategy, including international expansion and focus areas like renewables and digitalization.36 His background includes leadership roles in economics, telecommunications (CEO at Sunrise), and technology companies (TX Group, Swisscom, Bluewin) 40, suggesting a potential receptiveness to technology-driven solutions and fostering a tech-oriented mindset within Axpo. He also serves as Chairman of CKW AG.39
Harald Gauck, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Axpo Group
Appointed Group CFO in 2024, Mr. Gauck previously served as CFO of Axpo Solutions AG (2014-2024) and earlier as Head of Controlling & Services within the Trading & Sales business area (2008-2014).36 His extensive experience within the division most closely related to Axpo U.S.'s activities means he has a deep understanding of the trading business. The Group CFO oversees financial strategy, major investments, and risk management, making his office critical for financial approvals of significant technology contracts or platform changes.
Henriette Wendt, Chief Operating Officer (COO), Axpo Group
Ms. Wendt has been Group COO since June 2021.36 Her responsibilities are highly relevant as they integrally manage key steering functions including Corporate Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Technology Management, Partnering & Investing, Transformation & Group Projects, and Corporate Procurement.9 Her prior experience includes roles at Microsoft, Telia, Swisscom, and Motorola.39 The explicit inclusion of "Technology Management" and "Corporate Procurement" in her portfolio positions her as a central figure in decisions regarding significant technology adoption and vendor relationships for the entire Group, which could extend to solutions deployed within Axpo U.S.
The leadership structure suggests that while Axpo U.S. has local operational management with relevant international renewables experience, major strategic decisions, particularly those involving substantial technology investments or group-wide security frameworks, are likely influenced and approved at the Axpo Group level in Europe. This implies a need for a multi-level engagement strategy, addressing local U.S. requirements while also understanding the priorities and decision-making processes of the parent company's key executives.
2.2 Board of Directors (Axpo Holding AG)
The Board of Directors of Axpo Holding AG is appointed by the Shareholders' General Meeting (the cantons and cantonal utilities of northeastern Switzerland) for two-year terms. Members serve in non-executive capacities and are responsible for the ultimate strategic direction, oversight, and corporate governance of the Axpo Group.9 Key members with backgrounds relevant to Axpo's strategic focus areas include:
Thomas Sieber (Chairman): Mr. Sieber has been Chairman since March 2016. His background includes CEO and Chairman roles at Salt Mobile SA, and senior management positions at Hewlett Packard Inc. and Fujitsu Siemens Computers AG. He also serves on the Board of Directors of HCL Technologies, indicating familiarity with the technology sector.36
Stephan Kuhn (Vice Chairman): A board member since January 2018, Mr. Kuhn became Vice Chairman in January 2024. He chairs the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and is a member of the Strategy Committee. His prior career includes senior roles at Ernst & Young, focusing on tax and legal consulting, and advising financial institutions.36
Samuel Leupold (Chairman, Strategy Committee): Mr. Leupold joined the Board in January 2024 and chairs the Strategy Committee. His extensive experience includes serving as CEO of Ørsted Wind Power (a global leader in offshore wind), Head of International Energy and Trading at BKW, and roles at ABB and McKinsey. His focus is on energy and infrastructure.36
Stefan Kessler (Chairman, Audit and Finance Committee): A board member since January 2018, Mr. Kessler has chaired the Audit and Finance Committee since January 2019. His background includes a tenure as CFO and Executive Board member at Repower, another Swiss energy company.36
The composition of the Board, particularly the expertise of members like Samuel Leupold in global renewable energy and international trading, reinforces Axpo Group's strategic commitment to these areas. Mr. Leupold's leadership of the Strategy Committee suggests that this expertise directly influences Axpo's strategic planning, likely translating into continued support and resources for Axpo U.S.'s PPA origination and energy trading activities. This high-level strategic alignment indicates that solutions supporting secure and efficient renewable energy trading and PPA management would resonate with the Board's priorities.
2.3 IT and Security leadership (Axpo Group)
Given Axpo U.S. LLC's role as a subsidiary and its engagement in financially sensitive energy trading and PPA activities, the IT and security leadership at the Axpo Group level are critical stakeholders for solutions offered by NCC Group.
Jacopo Fumagalli, Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Axpo Services AG
Mr. Fumagalli is the Group CISO for Axpo, bringing over 20 years of cybersecurity experience. His previous leadership roles include CISO positions at Omya (a Swiss mining and distribution company) and Envista (formerly Danaher Dental, an American medical devices company). He has a stated special focus on Incident Response and Operational Technology (OT) security, areas of particular importance in the energy sector.10
Henriette Wendt, Group Chief Operating Officer (COO), Axpo Holding AG
As mentioned previously, the Group COO's responsibilities include Technology Management for the entire Axpo Group.9 This makes her a key executive overseeing the broader technology strategy and infrastructure decisions that would impact Axpo U.S.
Axpo Systems AG Leadership (Axpo Subsidiary focused on OT Security):
René Oester, CEO, Axpo Systems AG: Axpo Systems AG is positioned as Axpo Group's competence center for cybersecurity and data communication solutions, with a particular focus on system-critical infrastructures.13 Axpo Systems launched an OT Security Operation Centre (SOC) in Switzerland in December 2024.
Manuel Dietrich, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Axpo Systems AG: Mr. Dietrich was involved in the launch of the OT SOC, which notably utilizes SCION connectivity in partnership with Anapaya to enhance security and resilience for OT environments.12
The establishment of a dedicated OT SOC by Axpo Systems 12 and the Group CISO's explicit focus on OT security 10 clearly indicate a heightened awareness and strategic investment by Axpo Group in protecting industrial control systems and critical energy infrastructure. This proactive stance presents a significant alignment with NCC Group's specialized OT security services. While the current OT SOC is primarily focused on Swiss infrastructure, the expertise and frameworks developed could be highly relevant for Axpo's international operations, including supporting the security of generation assets linked to Axpo U.S.'s PPA activities.
2.4 Middle management in relevant departments (Axpo U.S. LLC)
Publicly available information from the provided sources does not identify specific middle management personnel within Axpo U.S. LLC for departments such as IT infrastructure, security operations, network administration, or procurement and vendor management. (Information Gap)
Analysis: Given the specialized nature and likely lean structure of Axpo U.S. as a subsidiary focused on trading and origination, it is plausible that many of these functions are either handled by senior U.S. staff under the Managing Director's oversight or are significantly supported and directed by centralized Axpo Group functions in Europe. For instance, Group IT and Technology Management fall under the Group COO, Group Procurement is also centralized, and the Group CISO directs the overall cybersecurity strategy.
2.5 Decision-making patterns
Organizational Decision Structures: Axpo Group exhibits a clear hierarchical structure. Strategic direction flows from the Axpo Holding AG Board of Directors and Executive Board to the leadership of its business areas, such as Axpo Solutions AG (Trading & Sales), and subsequently to subsidiaries like Axpo U.S. LLC.28
Known Approval Processes for Technology Purchases: Specific approval processes for technology purchases are not detailed in the provided information. (Information Gap)
Analysis: For significant technology investments, particularly those related to core trading platforms, enterprise-wide risk management systems, or group-level cybersecurity solutions, the approval process would likely originate with a needs assessment and proposal from Axpo U.S. management (Khoury). This would then escalate to Axpo Solutions AG leadership (De Luca) and relevant Group executives such as the Group CFO (Gauck) for financial approval, the Group COO (Wendt) for alignment with technology management and procurement policies, and the Group CISO (Fumagalli) for security-related solutions.
Budget Authorities and Financial Approval Thresholds: Specific details on budget authorities or financial approval thresholds are not publicly available. (Information Gap)
While Axpo U.S. likely possesses autonomy for routine operational decisions and expenditures, substantial investments in new technologies or comprehensive cybersecurity platforms would necessitate justification and formal approval from Axpo Solutions AG and potentially Axpo Group leadership in Switzerland. This is typical for multinational corporations to ensure strategic alignment, maintain oversight on capital expenditure, achieve economies of scale, and manage group-wide risk. Energy trading platforms and risk management systems are often standardized across global trading organizations for efficiency and centralized oversight. Similarly, cybersecurity is a group-level concern, with solutions often implemented based on a central framework defined by the Group CISO. The Group COO's direct responsibility for Technology Management and Corporate Procurement further suggests centralized governance over these critical areas.9

Recent Developments and Strategic Direction
This section analyzes Axpo's activities over the past 18 months to discern current priorities, strategic trajectory, and potential implications for technology and security needs.
3.1 Comprehensive news analysis from the past 18 months
A review of news and announcements from approximately December 2023 to June 2025 reveals key activities:
Timeline of Major Corporate Announcements:
Axpo U.S. LLC:
April 22, 2025: Axpo U.S. announced a significant, long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Danfoss. This agreement involves Axpo U.S. supplying renewable energy from the Shakes Solar farm in Texas (developed by Cypress Creek Renewables) to power 24 Danfoss factories and 36 other locations across the United States. The PPA extends through 2032 and underscores Axpo U.S.'s capability in structuring and delivering large-scale renewable energy solutions.11 Luke Tosheff, Axpo U.S. Senior Originator, was quoted in the announcement.
Axpo Group (Developments Relevant to U.S. Operations or Overall Strategy):
May 27, 2025: Axpo Group released its H1 2024/2025 financial results, reporting an adjusted EBIT of CHF 847 million. Despite market uncertainties, the results were described as good, with continued success in the international customer and trading business. As of September 2024, Axpo managed a 93 TWh energy portfolio in Europe and the USA and continued to secure important PPAs.23
May 2025: Axpo Holding AG issued a CHF 160 million bond, indicating access to capital markets for funding its initiatives.44
February 2025: Axpo Group successfully extended its existing EUR 7.0 billion syndicated credit line by one year, now running until February 2028. This early extension was highlighted as a vote of confidence from financial markets and provides financial flexibility for investments in the energy transition.23
January 28, 2025: Axpo Systems AG, an Axpo subsidiary, announced the launch of the first Operational Technology (OT) Security Operations Center (SOC) utilizing SCION connectivity, in partnership with Anapaya. This initiative aims to set new standards for securing critical infrastructure.12
December 11, 2024: Axpo Systems AG officially opened its OT Security Operation Centre in Switzerland, offering specialized protection for OT infrastructure in systemically important sectors like energy supply.13
Throughout 2024-2025: Axpo Group made numerous announcements regarding the expansion of its renewable energy projects across Europe, including investments in biomethane, solar, wind, and hydrogen initiatives.18
April 1, 2024: Axpo Holding AG acquired LINIA, a Swiss software company specializing in automated electricity grid inspection, to expand its service offerings and access new markets.32
Key Themes from Press Releases:
Axpo U.S.: Focus on growth within the North American PPA market, commitment to providing sustainable energy solutions, and forging partnerships with major industrial clients (e.g., Danfoss).
Axpo Group: Emphasis on financial stability and strong performance, leadership in European energy trading, aggressive expansion of its international renewables portfolio (solar, wind, hydrogen, biomass), a proactive approach to OT security, and continuous innovation.
Earnings Calls and Analyst Commentary:
As Axpo Holding AG is not publicly traded in the conventional sense, it does not hold typical earnings calls. Financial results and strategic updates are communicated through media conferences, annual reports, and interim reports.21 Analyst commentary generally positions Axpo Group as a leading energy trader in Europe 17, and market analysis points to significant growth potential for PPAs in both Europe and the USA.37
The Danfoss PPA stands out as a pivotal achievement for Axpo U.S. It not only demonstrates the capacity to structure and deliver complex, large-scale, long-term renewable energy solutions within the U.S. market but also likely serves as a catalyst for pursuing further similar opportunities. This ambition for growth in PPA origination will inherently increase operational complexity, data management needs, and the necessity for secure, efficient trading and risk management systems.
3.2 Strategic initiatives
Axpo Group's strategic direction is clearly articulated around three core pillars: 1) ensuring a secure energy supply, 2) driving the energy transition through the expansion of renewable energy sources, and 3) growing its customer business with sophisticated energy trading solutions.21 A key component of this strategy is international expansion, particularly in the customer and trading business and the renewables sector.25 The Group has set ambitious targets, including the development of 10 GW of solar and 3 GW of wind capacity internationally by 2030.6
Annual reports consistently prioritize reinforcing international leadership, expanding the renewables portfolio (with investments in solar, wind, hydrogen, biomass, storage, and grid modernization), ensuring supply security, and investing in innovation.21
Public statements from Axpo Group executives reinforce this strategic thrust. Group CEO Christoph Brand has emphasized the need for a "tech-driven mindset, agility, and faster execution cycles".41 Domenico De Luca, Head of Trading & Sales, has highlighted the strategy to expand international presence and the origination business, noting the significant market potential for PPAs.37 Kamal Khoury, Managing Director of Axpo U.S., has affirmed Axpo's expanding role in the North American energy market and its commitment to supporting a sustainable energy future.11
This strong strategic alignment between the Group's global ambitions—particularly in international energy trading and renewables—and the stated objectives of Axpo U.S. leadership clearly positions the U.S. entity as a critical vehicle for growth in North America. This implies ongoing investment and a concentrated effort to expand the U.S. business, which will likely lead to increased operational scale and a corresponding need for robust supporting infrastructure, including advanced cybersecurity measures.
3.3 Organizational changes
Over the past 18 months, the most notable leadership change at the Group level relevant to Axpo U.S.'s oversight was the appointment of Harald Gauck as Axpo Group CFO in 2024.36 Mr. Gauck's long prior tenure as CFO of Axpo Solutions AG provides him with deep familiarity with the trading business that forms the core of Axpo U.S.'s activities.
No major leadership changes specifically within Axpo U.S. have been publicly announced recently; Kamal Khoury continues as Managing Director. His transition from Axpo UK MD to lead Axpo U.S. occurred before this 18-month review window but forms relevant background to his current role. The initial Managing Director for Axpo U.S. in 2016 was Jeremy Wodakow.15
There have been no announcements of major restructuring initiatives or business unit realignments that directly affect Axpo U.S. LLC. The U.S. entity remains an integral part of the Axpo Solutions AG (Trading & Sales) business area. Similarly, no changes to the Axpo U.S. office locations in New York and Houston have been noted. Axpo Group, however, has been active in expanding facilities and projects in Europe.18
The stability in Axpo U.S. leadership and its physical footprint suggests a consistent operational approach and focus on market development. The key organizational context for Axpo U.S. often derives from Group-level strategic appointments and initiatives, such as the new Group CFO and the establishment of the OT SOC, which signal broader shifts in priorities and capabilities that will invariably influence subsidiary operations.
3.4 Financial developments

Analysis of strategic trajectory & Implications for technology and security priorities
Axpo U.S. is demonstrably on a growth trajectory within the North American energy market. Its strategic focus is clearly on PPA origination for renewable energy and providing sophisticated energy trading and risk management solutions to a discerning clientele. This trajectory inherently implies an increasing volume of complex financial and energy transactions, a growing need for advanced data management and analytics, and heightened exposure to market volatility and sophisticated cyber threats.
The strategic priorities of the parent, Axpo Group—particularly its aggressive global expansion in renewables, its commitment to digitalization, and its recent significant investments in OT security—further underscore the operational context for Axpo U.S. These group-level initiatives create a strong imperative for robust technology and security measures across all subsidiaries.
Implications for Technology and Security Priorities at Axpo U.S.:
Robust ETRM Systems: As trading volumes and PPA complexities grow, the need for scalable, secure, and highly available Energy Trading and Risk Management (ETRM) systems becomes paramount. These systems are the backbone of their operations.
Advanced Data Analytics: Effectively navigating volatile U.S. energy markets and optimizing PPA structures requires sophisticated data analytics capabilities for forecasting, pricing, and risk assessment.
Enhanced Cybersecurity: The financial value of transactions, coupled with sensitive counterparty data and critical market participation, necessitates a top-tier cybersecurity posture.

5.7 Leadership communication patterns from public sources
Public statements from Axpo's leadership consistently project a forward-looking and strategic orientation:
Group CEO Christoph Brand has emphasized the importance of Axpo adopting a "tech-driven mindset," fostering agility, and achieving faster execution cycles, indicating a push towards modernization and efficiency.41
Executives directly involved with the trading and U.S. businesses, such as Domenico De Luca (Head of Trading & Sales) and Kamal Khoury (Axpo U.S. MD), focus their communications on market opportunities, customer-centric solutions, and strategic growth in areas like PPAs and risk management.11
A common thread in leadership communications is the underscoring of Axpo's commitment to innovation and sustainability as key drivers of its business.
5.8 Recognition and awards for corporate culture
As noted previously, Axpo Group and its subsidiaries in Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal (Goldenergy), and Germany (Volkswind) have been recognized with "Great Place to Work®" awards.23 Axpo was also named a best employer in its sector in Switzerland by Handelszeitung.23 These awards serve as strong external validation of a positive corporate culture in multiple operational hubs, which can contribute to employee morale, talent attraction, and Axpo's reputation as a desirable business partner.

Alignment with Financial Reporting: Monitor Axpo Group's semi-annual and annual financial reports. If these reports indicate new U.S. expansion plans, investments in technology, or heightened discussion of risk management, use these as timely triggers for engagement.
Budget Cycles: While specific budget cycles for Axpo U.S. are an information gap, engagement ahead of typical corporate fiscal year planning (often Q3/Q4 for a calendar year, or adjusted for Axpo's October-September fiscal year) can be beneficial for inclusion in upcoming budgets.
Response to Industry Events: In the wake of major cybersecurity incidents affecting the energy sector globally or in the U.S., offer timely and relevant insights, threat briefings, or consultations to Axpo U.S. and Group security leadership.
New Group Initiatives: When Axpo Group announces new technology partnerships or security initiatives (e.g., the Anapaya partnership for SCION connectivity with the OT SOC), explore how NCC Group’s services can complement or extend these efforts, particularly in the U.S. context where such advanced solutions might be deployed.
