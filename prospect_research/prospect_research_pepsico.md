Specific locations of all manufacturing plants, R&amp;D centers, and major offices are extensive and not exhaustively listed in a single public document.

PepsiCo continually evaluates its structure. Recent activities have focused on integrating acquired businesses (e.g., Pioneer Foods in South Africa, Rockstar Energy), optimizing its supply chain, and investing in digitalization across its segments.
In 2022, PepsiCo announced it was pursuing the sale of a significant portion of its juice businesses (including Tropicana and Naked) in North America to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% non-controlling interest.

Areas of Expertise and Influence: Directors are chosen for their expertise in areas such as finance, international business, marketing, technology, sustainability, governance, and leadership.
IT and Security leadership:
CIO, CISO, CTO, and direct reports:
Analysis: The role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) is crucial. Currently, this position or an equivalent (e.g., Chief Digital and Information Officer) would be held by a senior executive. Athina Kanioura, as Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer, plays a significant role in the technology and digital agenda. (PepsiCo, n.d.k) The exact title for the top IT infrastructure leader and CISO may require deeper research through IT-specific news or LinkedIn. Information Gap: Precise names for CISO and specific direct reports often require more targeted research beyond standard corporate bios.
Hypothetical search strategy for CISO: Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or targeted searches like "CISO PepsiCo" or "VP Information Security PepsiCo."
Security operations leadership: This would typically fall under the CISO's organization. Information Gap
Compliance and risk management leadership: Often a shared responsibility between Legal (David Flavell), Finance (Jamie Caulfield), and the CISO's office, with specific leaders for areas like data privacy and regulatory compliance. Information Gap for specific names below C-suite.
Digital transformation leadership: Athina Kanioura (Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer) is central to this. Ram Krishnan (CEO of PBNA, formerly Chief Commercial Officer) also has a strong background in digital initiatives. (PepsiCo, n.d.d; PepsiCo, n.d.k)
Middle management in relevant departments: Information Gap
IT infrastructure managers, Security operations managers, Network and systems administrators, Procurement and vendor management contacts: Identifying these individuals typically requires specialized databases (like ZoomInfo, DiscoverOrg - not publicly available for this report) or very targeted LinkedIn searches which can be time-consuming and may not yield comprehensive public data. This is a common area where direct outreach or networking is needed.
Analysis: For NCC Group, identifying VPs or Directors of IT Infrastructure, Cybersecurity Operations, and IT Procurement would be key.
Decision-making patterns:
Organizational decision structures:
Analysis: PepsiCo likely has a hierarchical but also matrixed decision-making structure. Major strategic decisions (large M&amp;A, significant capital expenditures) are made at the executive leadership and board level. Operational and technology decisions within specific business units or geographies will have delegated authority, but major cross-cutting initiatives (like enterprise-wide cybersecurity solutions) would involve central IT, security leadership, and relevant business unit heads.
Known approval processes for technology purchases:
Analysis: Typically involves:
Business unit or functional department identifying a need.
Initial vetting by IT/Security for alignment with architecture and standards.
Budget approval process, often involving finance and departmental heads.
Procurement department managing RFP/RFQ processes and vendor negotiations.
Legal review of contracts.
Higher-level approvals (C-level, potentially board for very large investments) depending on the expenditure.
Information Gap: Specific internal approval thresholds are not public.
Budget authorities and financial approval thresholds: Not publicly detailed. Information Gap

Vision: While a single "vision statement" may vary, the core vision is embedded in the pep+ strategy: "to build a more sustainable food system" and drive "better outcomes for people and the planet, while simultaneously spurring business growth and value." (PepsiCo, n.d.l)
Values (The PepsiCo Way):
Be Consumer-Centric
Act as Owners
Focus and Get It Done Fast
Voice Opinions Fearlessly
Raise the Bar on Talent and Diversity
Celebrate Success
Act with Integrity (PepsiCo, n.d.m)
Corporate social responsibility initiatives: Extensively covered under the pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) strategy which integrates sustainability into the business strategy. Key pillars:
Positive Agriculture: Spreading regenerative practices, sustainably sourcing crops.
Positive Value Chain: Achieving Net-Zero emissions by 2040, becoming Net Water Positive by 2030, reducing virgin plastic use.
Positive Choices: Evolving its portfolio with more nutritious options, leveraging its brands to inspire positive choices. (PepsiCo, 2021a; PepsiCo, n.d.l)
Diversity and inclusion programs:
PepsiCo has numerous initiatives focused on racial equality, gender parity, and LGBTQ+ inclusion. They publish diversity reports and have set specific goals for representation.
Examples: "Racial Equality Journey" commitments in the U.S., investments in diverse suppliers, employee resource groups (ERGs). (PepsiCo, n.d.n)
Environmental and sustainability commitments: These are central to the pep+ strategy. Specific goals include:
Reducing absolute GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3).
Improving water-use efficiency and replenishing water in high-risk watersheds.
Designing packaging to be recyclable, compostable, biodegradable, or reusable.
Increasing recycled content in packaging. (Details are available in their annual Sustainability Reports and on the pep+ section of their website).
Corporate communications style:
Analysis: Generally professional, optimistic, and increasingly focused on purpose and sustainability alongside financial performance. Communications are tailored to different stakeholders (investors, consumers, employees, communities). They utilize a mix of traditional press releases, social media, detailed reports, and executive presentations.
Employee review themes from platforms like Glassdoor:
Analysis (General themes often found for large corporations like PepsiCo):
Pros: Good pay and benefits (often cited for corporate roles), opportunities for advancement in some areas, strong brand recognition, good work-life balance in certain roles/departments.
Cons: Bureaucracy and slow decision-making at times (common in large organizations), high pressure in sales roles, some concerns about work-life balance in demanding positions, potential for restructuring impacts.
(Note: These are general themes and should be verified by reviewing current Glassdoor/Indeed reviews for PepsiCo, as sentiment can change. Specific reviews will vary widely by location, department, and role.)
Leadership communication patterns from public sources:
Analysis: CEO Ramon Laguarta and other executives tend to communicate with a focus on long-term strategy (pep+), innovation, financial results, and the company's role in society. Communication is generally measured and aligned with corporate messaging. Earnings calls and investor presentations are key channels for detailed communication.
Recognition and awards for corporate culture: PepsiCo often receives awards related to being a top employer, best place to work for diversity, ethical company, etc., from various organizations and publications. (These are usually highlighted in their corporate news or careers sections). For example, Ethisphere Institute has recognized PepsiCo as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies multiple times.

Information Gaps Requiring Further Research:

Precise employee count by department.
A comprehensive list of every operational facility (manufacturing, R&amp;D, distribution) and its specific size.
Specific names and contact details for IT/Security leadership below the executive C-suite level (e.g., CISO direct reports, Security Operations Leadership, Compliance and Risk Management Leadership within IT/Security).
Specific names and contact details for middle management in IT infrastructure, security operations, network/systems administration, and procurement/vendor management.
Detailed internal organizational charts, especially for IT and security departments.
Specific internal approval processes and budget authority thresholds for technology purchases.
Precise, current, and comprehensive market share data across all product categories and geographies (typically requires paid market research reports).
Detailed internal influence maps beyond what can be inferred from public reporting structures.
This concludes the research for Part 1. The subsequent sections of the report (Executive Summary, Leadership Analysis, Recent Developments, etc.) would be constructed and elaborated upon based on this foundational research.
