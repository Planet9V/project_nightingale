GTM Strategy: NRG Energy (NCC Group + Dragos + Adelard) - “The Resilient Energy Future”
1. Executive Summary (for Internal Use)
NRG Energy, a large and diversified energy company with a complex mix of generation assets, retail operations, and a growing smart home business (Vivint), faces a multifaceted threat landscape and evolving regulatory pressures. This GTM strategy takes an innovative approach, combining proactive threat simulation, gamified security awareness, and a focus on the emerging challenges of AI and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). We will leverage the Dragos 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report (highlighting threats like VOLTZITE, ELECTRUM, ransomware, and supply chain risks) and Adelard’s safety case expertise, but we’ll go beyond simply presenting the data. We will position NCC Group, Dragos, and Adelard as partners in building a resilient energy future, not just vendors selling security products. The approach will be highly consultative, emphasizing long-term partnership, proactive risk management, and a demonstrable commitment to innovation.
2. Target Account Profile: NRG Energy
Industry: Integrated Power Company (Generation, Retail, Home Services)
Business Model: Generates electricity from diverse sources (natural gas, coal, nuclear, renewables), sells electricity and natural gas to retail customers, and provides smart home services (through Vivint).
Likely OT/IT/IoT Environment:
SCADA, PLCs, DCS for power generation.
Energy Management Systems (EMS) for grid operations.
Extensive IT infrastructure for retail operations and customer data management.
Smart home devices (thermostats, security systems) connected to a cloud platform (Vivint).
Growing VPP infrastructure (integrating distributed energy resources).
Connections to the electricity grid (NERC CIP compliance).
Connections to natural gas pipelines.
Likely a high degree of IT/OT/IoT convergence.
Significant use of AI and machine learning (as evidenced by their partnership with Google Cloud).
Key Concerns (Inferred):
Operational Reliability: Maintaining continuous power generation and avoiding outages.
Safety: Preventing incidents that could impact personnel, the public, or the environment.
Regulatory Compliance: Meeting NERC CIP, FERC, and other requirements.
Financial Performance: Avoiding downtime, fines, and reputational damage.
Ransomware: Protecting against attacks that could disrupt operations or compromise customer data.
Espionage: Protecting against nation-state actors.
Supply Chain Security: Managing risks associated with a complex network of vendors and suppliers.
Insider Threats: Mitigating risks from malicious or negligent employees.
AI Security: Ensuring the secure and responsible deployment of AI technologies.

3. Threat Landscape (Leveraging Dragos 2025 Report and Beyond)
Primary Threats:
VOLTZITE: (GIS data exfiltration, VPN targeting) - Highly relevant to NRG’s operations.
ELECTRUM: (Destructive malware) - Demonstrates the potential for catastrophic attacks.
Ransomware: (87% increase) - A major threat to all aspects of NRG’s business.
Supply Chain Attacks: (Increasing frequency) - NRG’s reliance on numerous vendors creates vulnerabilities.
KAMACITE:
Relevance: persistent state-affiliate threat group.
Why it Matters: KAMACITE establishes initial network footholds through phishing.
Emerging Threats (Beyond the Report):
AI-Specific Attacks: Targeting NRG’s AI-powered VPP and other AI-driven systems (model poisoning, data manipulation, adversarial examples).
VPP Vulnerabilities: Exploiting weaknesses in the communication and control systems of distributed energy resources.
Smart Home Device Exploitation: Using compromised Vivint devices as a gateway to attack NRG’s infrastructure or customers.
4. Value Proposition (NCC Group + Dragos + Adelard) - “Building a Resilient Energy Future”

5. Sales Plays (Actionable Steps) - Innovative Approach
Play 1: “The Resilient Energy Future Workshop” (Initial Engagement)
Goal: Secure an initial workshop, not just a meeting, with a cross-functional team from NRG Energy (OT, IT, security, operations, compliance, AI/VPP teams, safety).
Approach:
High-Impact Invitation: Frame the workshop as a strategic discussion about building a resilient energy future, not just a cybersecurity sales pitch. Example: “Invitation: Shaping the Future of Energy Resilience - A Strategic Workshop for NRG Energy.”
Workshop Format:
Part 1: Threat Landscape Overview (Interactive): Present the key threats from the Dragos 2025 report and emerging threats (AI, VPPs). Use interactive polling and Q&A to gauge NRG’s understanding and concerns.
Part 2: Threat Simulation Exercise (Gamified): Conduct a simplified, tabletop exercise simulating a realistic attack scenario (e.g., VOLTZITE targeting GIS data, ransomware attack on a power plant, AI model poisoning attack on the VPP). Use a gamified approach to make it engaging and memorable.
Part 3: Solution Brainstorming: Facilitate a discussion about how NCC Group, Dragos, and Adelard can help NRG address the identified challenges and build a more resilient infrastructure.
Part 4: Action Planning: Develop a preliminary action plan with specific next steps.
Key Differentiator: The interactive and gamified approach will make this workshop stand out from typical vendor presentations.
