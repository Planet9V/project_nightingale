---

## 7. Actionable Intelligence

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- CVE-2021-22763 (Schneider) in 18% facilities [3]
- FrostyGoop Modbus configs matching Ford SCADA [14]

### Budget Signals
- $9B CapEx allocated for EV tech [7]
- $500M cloud security initiative [4]

### Regulatory Timeline
- Q1 2025: UNECE R155 Enforcement [12]
- Q3 2025: CA Fleet Electrification [17]

---

## 8. Engagement Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Mitigation
- Deploy protocol-aware firewalls at 5 key plants
- Conduct SCADA gap analysis using CISA ICS protocols [14]

### Phase 2: Medium-Term
- Implement Zero Trust for 400+ vendor network [8]
- Co-develop R155 compliance toolkit

### Phase 3: Strategic
- Establish joint OT SOC with Ford Pro team
- Embed security in BlueOval City expansion
Key Evidence: 1. Modbus TCP exposure in 85% plants ([3][14]) 2. 44k record breach showing PII risks ([13]) 3. $9B EV CapEx creating new attack surfaces ([7][11])
Recommended Actions: 1. Leverage Upstream Security partnership for vehicle integration [12] 2. Target Ford Pro’s $8B-$9B EBIT segment for security upsell [17]
