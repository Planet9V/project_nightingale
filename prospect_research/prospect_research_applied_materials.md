CIO: Brice Hill, SVP, CFO, also oversees Global Information Services (GIS).2 Jay O. Kerley was previously Group VP & CIO (CIO since 2010, GVP since 2013, joined AMAT in 2006).61 Analysis: The current structure with the CFO also overseeing GIS suggests a strong link between financial strategy and IT investment. Jay Kerley's long tenure as CIO established the GIS organization. It is important to clarify if Jay Kerley is still with the company or if Brice Hill has fully absorbed the CIO responsibilities with a direct CIO reporting to him. Snippet 61 shows Jay Kerley as SVP & CIO, while 41 (Brice Hill's bio) states Hill "oversees Global Information Services." This needs clarification for precise targeting. Assuming Hill has ultimate oversight.
CISO: Kannan Perumal is Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) since December 2020.61 He has over 18 years in information security, responsible for overall cybersecurity strategy and implementation. Previously held roles like Managing Director, Senior Director, Director, and Senior Manager in security at Applied Materials.

Holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics & Communication from Madurai Kamaraj University and CISSP (expired 2020).71
CTO: Dr. Omkaram (Om) Nalamasu is SVP, CTO, and President of Applied Ventures, LLC.2
Security operations leadership:
Nick Miller: Director - Security Operations (reports to Kannan Perumal).61
Scott Fike: Head of Global Security Operations.61
A job posting for "Senior Director, Global Security Operations" indicates this role manages development, oversight, and execution of security operations globally, including Security & Business Resiliency programs, federal regulatory programs, guard force services, asset protection, investigations, event security, emergency preparedness, and workplace violence prevention. This role has budget accountability and reports on KPIs/SLAs. It involves cross-functional collaboration with IT, Facilities, Finance, Legal, HR, etc..73 This role would report to a higher level, possibly the CSO or CISO.
Compliance and risk management leadership:
Ramu Duvur: Senior Director of Information Security and Risk Management.61
Rajesh Potturi: Senior Director, Information Security & Risk Management (reports to Kannan Perumal).61
Lori Kessler: Program Director for Information Security and Risk Management.61
Malli Vittalam: Sr. Manager, Information Security & Risk Management (reports to Kannan Perumal).61
The Audit Committee of the Board has oversight of cybersecurity risks and the company's ethical compliance.68
Digital transformation leadership: KC Ong, GVP, Worldwide Manufacturing, has leadership for "Smart / Digital Operations" within semiconductor manufacturing.59 Tristan Holtam, GVP, CEO Chief of Staff, Corporate Strategy and Development, is involved in broader strategic discussions, including AI and technology leadership.58 The CEO, Gary Dickerson, often speaks about enabling industry megatrends like AI and IoT, implying a top-down drive for digital enablement.25 Brice Hill's oversight of Global Information Services also places him in a key position for digital transformation initiatives from an IT perspective.41
Analysis: Digital transformation appears to be driven both from an operational (manufacturing via KC Ong) and strategic/IT (Hill, Holtam, Dickerson) perspective. This distributed leadership for digital initiatives means NCC Group may need to engage multiple stakeholders to understand the full scope of digital transformation and associated security needs.
Middle management in relevant departments:
IT infrastructure managers: Sudipto Biswas (Vice President Information Technology), Deepak Tanniru (Sr. Director IT).61 (Further detailed middle management not available in snippets).
Security operations managers: Nick Miller (Director - Security Operations), Scott Fike (Head of Global Security Operations).61 Renny Jose Thottan (Manager Cloud Security).72
Network and systems administrators: (Specific names not available in snippets).
Procurement and vendor management contacts: Paul Chhabra, Ph.D. (GVP, Global Supply Chain) would be the executive lead.2 Specific procurement managers for technology or security are not listed. The job posting for Senior Director, Global Security Operations mentions developing and managing operational metrics and KPIs with strategic vendors.73
Information Gap: Detailed middle management org chart for IT, Security, and Procurement is not publicly available and would require deeper discovery. Contact information for these roles is also generally not public.
Decision-making patterns:
Organizational decision structures: Likely a hierarchical structure with strategic decisions made by the ELT and Board, cascaded down to business units and functional groups. The presence of a "Joint Operations Leadership Team" (led by Raman Achutharaman) suggests cross-functional coordination for operational matters.2 The CFO (Brice Hill) overseeing Global Information Services implies that IT and major technology investments are closely tied to financial strategy and approval.41
Known approval processes for technology purchases: Specific internal approval processes are not detailed in public snippets. However, for significant technology investments, especially those impacting security or core infrastructure, one would expect involvement from the CISO (Perumal), the head of GIS (Hill), relevant business unit leaders (e.g., Raja for SPG), and potentially the CTO (Nalamasu) for strategic alignment. The job posting for Senior Director, Global Security Operations mentions budget accountability and the need to explain proposed initiatives to senior leaders, indicating a formal approval process for security projects.73
Budget authorities and financial approval thresholds: Not publicly available. These are typically internal confidential policies. CFO Brice Hill would have ultimate oversight of major financial approvals.
Analysis: The decision-making for technology, especially security, likely involves a multi-layered approval process. For OT security, the SPG leadership (Prabu Raja) and manufacturing leadership (KC Ong) would be critical stakeholders alongside the CISO and GIS head. The strategic investment in Besi for hybrid bonding 33, driven by the importance of advanced packaging for AI, illustrates how technology adoption is linked to strategic market opportunities, likely involving the CEO, CTO, and relevant business group presidents in the decision. Procurement of AI-related technologies, as highlighted in a general article on AI in procurement 74, may involve machine learning for spend classification and supplier data capture, suggesting an evolving tech adoption landscape.

Analysis: The leadership structure shows clear lines of responsibility for major business segments (SPG, AGS, Display) and critical functions (Finance/GIS, Legal, HR, CTO). The CISO reports into the GIS structure, ultimately under the CFO. This dual role of the CFO (Brice Hill) covering traditional finance and Global Information Services is significant. It implies that IT strategy, including cybersecurity investments, will be heavily scrutinized from a financial and business enablement perspective. Decisions on security spending are likely to require strong ROI justification and alignment with overall business objectives. This structure also means that the CISO (Kannan Perumal) has a direct line to a C-suite executive who is deeply involved in the company's financial planning and IT infrastructure decisions, potentially streamlining budget advocacy if aligned with GIS strategic priorities.

Applied Materials' extensive portfolio, covering numerous semiconductor manufacturing processes, stands as a significant competitive advantage. Unlike ASML, which is highly specialized in lithography, or Lam Research, which has core strengths primarily in etch and deposition, Applied Materials offers solutions across a broader spectrum, including deposition, etch, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), ion implantation, and inspection.3 This breadth allows the company to offer "Integrated Materials Solutions," where multiple process steps are co-optimized within a single system or across linked systems, providing unique value to customers.10 However, this diversification necessitates substantial and widespread R&D investment to maintain leadership across all these fronts. For fiscal year 2023, R&D spending was approximately $3 billion 89, and for the first half of fiscal 2025, it reached $1.752 billion.88 This continuous need to innovate across a diverse range of complex technologies, while competing with specialists in each niche, presents an ongoing strategic challenge. The implication for security is a vast and varied Operational Technology (OT) footprint. Securing this diverse array of proprietary manufacturing technologies, from legacy systems to cutting-edge tools used in facilities like the EPIC Center, is a complex undertaking. This complexity presents an opportunity for NCC Group to highlight its capability in addressing diverse OT environments and protecting high-value intellectual property.
The semiconductor ecosystem involves intricate relationships where major customers like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are also significant R&D powerhouses.89 These leading chipmakers possess sophisticated internal engineering capabilities and often develop their own proprietary manufacturing processes or heavily customize vendor equipment. While they rely on equipment suppliers like Applied Materials for the majority of their manufacturing lines, their internal R&D efforts constantly push technological boundaries, setting high expectations for what vendors must deliver. Furthermore, these customers compete intensely among themselves, driving demand for unique technological advantages from their equipment suppliers. Consequently, Applied Materials must not only out-innovate direct competitors but also continuously demonstrate superior value over potential in-house solutions or modifications by its largest, most sophisticated clients. This dynamic places immense pressure on innovation speed and the protection of intellectual property, especially within collaborative R&D environments such as the planned EPIC Center. The security of these joint development efforts is paramount, as any leakage of sensitive information could benefit not only direct competitors but also these powerful "frenemy" customers.
