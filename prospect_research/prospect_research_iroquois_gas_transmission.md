GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP
This report presents the first part of a three-part comprehensive Go-to-Market (GTM) analysis for NCC Group's sales team, focusing on Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP. This section provides a detailed understanding of the organization's structure, leadership, and overall operational context.
Executive Summary
Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. (Iroquois) is a significant interstate natural gas pipeline operator in the U.S. Northeast, established in 1985 and commencing full operations in 1992.1 The company transports Canadian natural gas primarily to markets in New York and Connecticut, serving as a critical component of the region's energy infrastructure, particularly for local distribution companies (LDCs) and power generation facilities.1
Organizationally, Iroquois is a Delaware limited partnership, a structure common in the midstream energy sector. Its ownership is equally divided, with 50% held by subsidiaries of TC Energy and 50% by subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE GT&S, LLC).5 This ownership by two major energy infrastructure players provides substantial financial backing and strategic oversight. The company's core values emphasize safety, reliability, and environmental responsibility, which are consistently reflected in its operations and public communications.1 The pipeline system itself spans approximately 414 miles from the U.S.-Canadian border into New York City and Long Island.1
The operational aspects of the pipeline are managed by its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC), headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut.1 As of January 2025, Scott E. Rupff serves as the President of IPOC, succeeding Jeff Bruner.8 The executive team also includes Paul R. Amato, Senior Vice President of Operations, who notably holds responsibility for security; Kimberly Pritchard, Vice President & General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer; and Michelle Wieler, Senior Director of Financial Services & Chief Financial Officer.10
A major recent development is the ongoing "Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project." This initiative aims to increase the pipeline's capacity through significant upgrades to its compressor stations.11 While facing regulatory reviews and environmental concerns, the project is positioned by Iroquois and supported by regional utilities as vital for ensuring energy reliability in the Northeast.13 Recent leadership promotions, effective January 2025, suggest a strategic focus on operational continuity and navigating this period of significant investment and transition.8
In the competitive landscape, Iroquois holds a strong position within a critical energy corridor characterized by high demand. This is underscored by a "BBB+" credit rating with a stable outlook from S&P Global Ratings, indicating a robust business risk profile and competitive standing.15 However, it faces competition from other major pipeline systems serving the Northeast, such as Algonquin Gas Transmission, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line.
Organizational Profile
This section details the foundational aspects of Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., covering its legal and corporate structure, history, operational scale, and ownership.
1. Organization Overview
Full legal name and corporate structure:
The full legal name of the organization is Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P..1 It is structured as a Delaware limited partnership.1 This limited partnership (LP) structure is prevalent in the midstream energy sector, often chosen for its tax efficiencies and suitability for investment by multiple entities. Operating as a Delaware LP provides a well-established and flexible legal framework. Such a structure typically implies a focus on generating and distributing cash flows to its partners, which in this case are TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Consequently, strategic decisions and operational priorities are likely to be heavily influenced by the objectives of these parent entities, emphasizing operational efficiency, stringent regulatory compliance, and a satisfactory return on investment.
Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations:
Iroquois Gas Transmission System was created in 1985, with its full operations commencing in 1992.1 This timeline indicates a mature asset with several decades of operational history in the U.S. Northeast. The pipeline's operations are managed by its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC). IPOC's corporate headquarters, which also houses the critical gas control center, is located in Shelton, Connecticut.1 The pipeline system itself is extensive, covering 414 miles (approximately 667 kilometers).1 It originates at the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York, traverses New York State and western Connecticut, and terminates in Commack, New York (on Long Island), with an additional extension to Hunts Point in the Bronx, New York.1 The maturity of this infrastructure suggests potential ongoing needs for modernization, upgrades to address aging components, and enhancements to meet evolving regulatory and market demands. These factors could present opportunities for specialized service providers. The centralization of operational control, including the SCADA systems, in Shelton, Connecticut, identifies this location as a primary point of contact and influence for operational technology and security matters.
Organizational history and key milestones:
Iroquois was established in 1985 as a cooperative venture with the specific aim of diversifying the energy supply to the U.S. Northeast and providing competitively-priced natural gas to the region.1 Full operations began in 1992, marking the start of its role in the regional energy landscape.1
A consistent theme throughout Iroquois's history has been community engagement, evidenced by initiatives such as the Land Preservation and Enhancement Program (LPEP) launched in 1991, its successor the Land Enhancement and Acquisition Fund (LEAF) which ran from 1995 to 2006, and the ongoing Community Grant Program established in 2007.21
A pivotal current milestone is the Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project. The application for this project (Docket No. CP20-48-000) was filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in February 2020.11 FERC granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the ExC Project on March 25, 2022.11 Subsequently, by February 2025, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) approved crucial Air State Facility permits for the project's compressor station upgrades in Dover and Athens, New York.12 The ExC Project, which involves adding new compression and gas cooling facilities at four existing compressor stations, has a proposed in-service date of November 1, 2027.12 FERC later granted an extension of time until March 25, 2027, for Iroquois to complete construction and place the project facilities into service.12
The ownership of Iroquois has also evolved. In 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners acquired a 25.93% stake in the company.1 More significantly, in a transaction announced in July 2020 and expected to close in the fourth quarter of that year, Berkshire Hathaway Energy acquired Dominion Energy's gas transmission and storage business, which included a 50% interest in Iroquois Gas Transmission System.1 TC Energy holds the remaining 50% ownership.1
The ExC project, despite a protracted timeline and navigating considerable regulatory and environmental scrutiny 13, highlights the persistent and critical demand for natural gas in the Northeast and Iroquois's essential function in meeting that demand. This project involves substantial upgrades to Operational Technology (OT) by installing new compression and gas cooling systems and integrating them into the existing infrastructure at multiple compressor station sites, including Athens, Dover, Brookfield, and Milford.11 The Northeast U.S. has historically faced challenges with gas supply adequacy, particularly during peak winter demand periods. Coupled with the increasing difficulty of obtaining regulatory approvals for entirely new pipeline constructions due to environmental opposition 13, enhancing existing infrastructure through methods like compression upgrades (as with the ExC project) has become a more viable strategy for capacity expansion. The complexity of the ExC project and the integration of new OT systems with established infrastructure inherently elevate cyber risk, creating a sustained need for cybersecurity expertise throughout the project's lifecycle, which extends to 2027.12
Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):
The primary business activity of Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. is the interstate transportation of natural gas.1 It is important to note that Iroquois does not engage in the production of natural gas, nor does it own the gas it transports; its role is to provide transportation services for various shippers, including LDCs and power plants.1
The company's operations are classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 486210 (Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas).31 Correspondingly, its Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 4922 (Natural Gas Transmission).17 While an alternative NAICS code (237120 - Oil and Gas Pipeline and Related Structures Construction) and associated SIC codes (like 1623 or 1389) have been noted 32, the NAICS 486210 and SIC 4922 codes most accurately reflect Iroquois's core function as an operator of natural gas transmission infrastructure.
As a transporter of natural gas, Iroquois operates critical national infrastructure. This designation brings with it heightened regulatory oversight concerning safety, security, and operational reliability, particularly for its Operational Technology (OT) systems. Adherence to standards such as those from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Pipeline Security Guidelines, and potentially NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards (if direct connections to bulk power system assets exist), are significant operational drivers.
Precise company size metrics:
Annual revenue: Specific recent annual revenue figures for Iroquois are not publicly available in the provided information. S&P Global Ratings, in May 2025, indicated that Iroquois's historical operating and financial performance has been consistent with projections, expecting steady future performance due to the contractual nature of its pipeline services.15 A prior S&P report from April 2019 had affirmed a 'BBB+' rating.15 While CBonds lists a figure of "8 mln USD," this is exceptionally low for an operation of this scale and likely refers to a specific bond issuance or another financial metric rather than total annual revenue.17 More indicative, though dated, is the 2015 projection that Dominion Midstream's 25.93% stake in Iroquois would contribute approximately $20 million annually in cash flows, suggesting a total cash flow for Iroquois around $77 million at that time; revenue would typically be higher.26 The absence of precise, recent public revenue figures is characteristic of privately held limited partnerships or subsidiaries of large corporations. The consistent 'BBB+' rating from S&P implies financial stability.15 An information gap exists regarding precise recent annual revenue.
Employee count: Iroquois Gas Transmission System is reported to have approximately 116 total employees.33 This figure is corroborated by a statement from Paul Amato, SVP Operations, who described Iroquois as a small company, though he cited "less than 100 people" 34, which may be a slightly older or rounded figure. Operating a 414-mile critical infrastructure pipeline with multiple compressor and meter stations 1 with such a lean employee base suggests a high degree of automation and a significant reliance on sophisticated technology, including SCADA systems, for operational control and monitoring. This lean structure likely necessitates the use of third-party contractors for specialized tasks, including aspects of IT/OT support, maintenance, and project execution. The company's official "Vendors" page and its "Drug & Alcohol Program Requirements" for contractors confirm the routine engagement of external entities.37 This reliance on contractors could be an avenue for engagement if NCC Group can position itself as a specialized, trusted partner for OT security. Furthermore, a small internal team might be more receptive to expert external support for complex domains like OT cybersecurity, and it underscores the importance of robust supply chain security measures for Iroquois. A breakdown of employee count by department is an information gap.
Market capitalization if publicly traded: Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. is a privately held entity and is not publicly traded. It is owned by subsidiaries of TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.1 Therefore, market capitalization is not applicable.
Growth rate and financial trajectory: S&P Global Ratings anticipates "steady performance, supported by the contractual nature of the pipeline".15 The primary visible growth initiative is the ExC Project, designed to increase transportation capacity by 125,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d).12 This project signifies a clear path for organic growth driven by sustained regional energy demand. The affirmation of the "BBB+" credit rating with a stable outlook by S&P in May 2025, February 2024, and May 2024 further indicates financial health and a stable trajectory.17 The company's revenue model, based on long-term transportation contracts, contributes to this financial stability.
Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations:
The Iroquois pipeline system extends for 414 miles (per 1) or 416 miles (per 3). It originates at the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, New York, where it interconnects with the TC Energy Canadian Mainline (formerly TransCanada PipeLines Limited) near Iroquois, Ontario.4 From Waddington, the pipeline traverses New York State, including notable counties such as Greene and Dutchess (sites for the ExC project upgrades 11), and continues through western Connecticut, including Fairfield and New Haven counties (also sites for ExC project upgrades 11). The system terminates at Commack, New York, on Long Island, and also extends to Hunts Point in the Bronx, New York.1
Key facilities along the pipeline include:
Compressor Stations: The ExC project involves upgrades at Athens, NY; Dover, NY; Brookfield, CT; and Milford, CT.11 Other existing compressor stations are located at Wright, Croghan, and Boonville, NY.36 Iroquois's website indicates a total of seven compressor stations on its system.4
Meter Stations: A job posting mentioned 24 meter stations are part of the system monitored by Gas System Controllers.40
Main Line Valves and Power Plant Interconnects: These are also part of the infrastructure, as shown on their interactive pipeline map.35
Specific operational points highlighted for in-line inspection tool activities include Northport, NY, and Hunts Point, NY.41 The corporate headquarters for the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC), which includes the primary gas control center, is located at One Corporate Drive, Suite 600, Shelton, CT 06484.1 The pipeline's route through densely populated and economically vital areas underscores the critical importance of its uninterrupted and secure operation. Any service disruption could have significant regional impacts. The geographic distribution across multiple states also means Iroquois must navigate different state-level regulatory environments and coordinate with various local public safety organizations. The locations involved in the ExC project (Athens, Dover, Brookfield, Milford) represent current hubs of significant operational activity and are therefore key areas for potential engagement regarding OT security and modernization.
Detailed corporate structure including:
Parent-subsidiary relationships: Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. is the primary asset-owning entity. The Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC), based in Shelton, CT, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the LP and serves as the agent for and operator of the pipeline system.1 This is a standard operational arrangement in the midstream sector, separating asset ownership from operational management.
Business units and divisions: The executive leadership structure, which includes a President, SVP Operations, VP & General Counsel, CFO, and Director Commercial 10, suggests a functional organizational design. The Operations division, under SVP Paul Amato, is particularly extensive, encompassing Engineering, Environmental Management, Field Operations, Gas Control Operations, Health & Safety, Security, and Procurement.10
Recent restructuring initiatives: The primary organizational shifts have been in leadership, with several key promotions and a presidential retirement effective January 1, 2025.8 These changes represent a significant renewal of the top leadership team rather than a fundamental restructuring of business units or a divestment of assets. Such leadership transitions can often create openings for reviewing existing strategies, operational practices, and vendor relationships, including those related to security.
Merger and acquisition history: Key M&A activities include:
In September 2015, Dominion Midstream Partners, LP acquired a 25.93% ownership interest in Iroquois from affiliates of National Grid plc and New Jersey Resources Corporation.1 Dominion Midstream itself had been formed by Dominion Resources in March 2014.18
A major shift occurred in July 2020 when Berkshire Hathaway Energy announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of Dominion Energy's (formerly Dominion Resources) natural gas transmission and storage business. This transaction included Dominion's 50% stake in Iroquois Gas Transmission System.1
Historical SEC filings indicate that Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. had a CIK (1118488) and filed reports until a "Suspension of duty to report" (Form 15-15D) was filed on March 17, 2006.45 This suggests a period of public reporting prior to becoming a more closely held private entity. The current ownership structure, an equal 50/50 split between TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE) 1, represents a consolidation under two exceptionally large, financially sound, and highly experienced players in the energy infrastructure domain. TC Energy has a long-standing historical connection, with TransCanada being one of the original partners.4 BHE's entry through the acquisition of Dominion's assets in 2020 brought another formidable North American energy investor into the partnership.27 This balanced ownership implies a shared strategic direction and robust oversight from both parent corporations. For external entities like NCC Group, this means that engagement strategies should consider the potential influence and established standards of these parent companies. Both TC Energy and BHE are likely to have mature corporate governance frameworks, which would include stringent cybersecurity expectations for their operational subsidiaries. Understanding the overarching security programs and vendor preferences of TC Energy and BHE could provide valuable context when approaching Iroquois.
Ownership structure:
Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. is a privately held limited partnership.33 It is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.
As of the most recent information available, the ownership is evenly split between two major energy conglomerates:
TC Energy: Holds a 50% interest. This is structured through its subsidiaries: TC PipeLines, LP (which holds 49.34% via TC PipeLines GP, Inc.) and TransCanada Iroquois LLC (which holds 0.66% via TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd.).1
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE): Holds a 50% interest through its subsidiary BHE GT&S, LLC. This is structured through: Iroquois, Inc. (holding 24.07% via Eastern Energy Gas Holdings, LLC) and Iroquois GP Holding Company, LLC (holding 25.93% via Iroquois, Inc.).1 Rextag's summary aligns with this, showing TC PipeLines (49.34%), Berkshire (implicitly their total share, with 24.07% directly attributed in one part of the display), and TransCanada (0.66%) 4, which, when combined, reflects the 50/50 split detailed on Iroquois's official ownership page.5 The most significant recent ownership change was Berkshire Hathaway Energy's acquisition of Dominion Energy's 50% stake in Iroquois, as part of a larger transaction involving Dominion's gas transmission and storage assets, announced in July 2020.1 Prior to this, Dominion Midstream Partners had increased its holding by acquiring a 25.93% stake in 2015.1 The ownership by these two major energy infrastructure companies provides Iroquois with substantial financial stability and access to deep industry expertise. Decisions made at Iroquois will invariably align with the broader strategic objectives and rigorous governance standards of both TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

Leadership Analysis
This section examines the leadership structure of Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., focusing on the executive team of its operating subsidiary, Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC), the nature of its board/governance, and key personnel in IT and security roles.
2. Leadership and Decision Makers
Executive leadership team (Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company - IPOC):
The day-to-day operations and management of the Iroquois pipeline are vested in the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company (IPOC), a wholly-owned subsidiary.1 The executive leadership team of IPOC, as of early 2025, includes:
Scott E. Rupff, President (effective January 2025) 8: Mr. Rupff brings over 38 years of experience in the natural gas industry to his role. Prior to becoming President, he served as IPOC's Vice President of Marketing, Development & Commercial Operations. He joined Iroquois in 1994, having previously been employed by The Long Island Lighting Company in its gas supply organization. Mr. Rupff holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from Bucknell University. His areas of expertise encompass marketing and sales, rate-making, business development, strategic planning, and commercial operations, including gas control initiatives. He is an active participant in several industry organizations, serving as a board member of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), the Northeast Gas Association (NGA), and the Society of Gas Lighting (SOGL), and is a member of the National Petroleum Council (NPC).10 His public communications include statements upon his presidential appointment and a message in the 2025 Iroquois safety calendar, emphasizing safety and stakeholder communication.8 A LinkedIn profile is suggested to exist but was inaccessible.49
Paul R. Amato, Senior Vice President Operations (promotion effective January 2025) 8: With over 37 years of executive and engineering experience in the natural gas sector, Mr. Amato has held various leadership positions within Iroquois since joining in 1997. His prior experience includes roles at Algonquin Gas Transmission and the State of Connecticut's Gas Pipeline Safety Unit.10 He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Connecticut.8 As SVP Operations, Mr. Amato has comprehensive oversight of the company's Engineering, Environmental, Field Operations, Gas Control Operations, Health & Safety, Security, and Procurement functions.10 This explicitly includes responsibility for security, a critical area for NCC Group's engagement. Mr. Amato is highly active in the industry, currently chairing the Siemens SGT400 International Users Group and serving as a member of the INGAA Pipeline Safety Executive Committee and the INGAA Foundation Executive Committee (currently Chair of the INGAA Foundation).10 He has also testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety regarding pipeline safety.52 His LinkedIn profile is noted in industry publications.34
Kimberly Pritchard, Vice President & General Counsel (promoted to Sr. Director, Legal Services & General Counsel effective January 2025) 8: Ms. Pritchard has over 34 years of experience in legal and compliance roles. She joined Iroquois in 2013, having previously worked for Vermont Electric Transmission Company (also referred to as Vermont Electric Power Company).8 Her educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Vermont State University, completion of a four-year law clerkship program, a degree in Legal Studies from Champlain College, and completion of the Harvard Business School of Executive Education Leadership Program for Senior Executives.8 She is a SHRM Senior Certified Professional and is licensed to practice law in Vermont and Connecticut. At Iroquois, Ms. Pritchard is responsible for legal affairs, human resources, right-of-way management, and records management, and serves as the Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary.10 She is a member of INGAA's Legal Rates Committee, the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM), the Vermont Bar Association, and the American Bar Association.10 A FERC contact list also identifies her as Sr. Attorney and Corporate Secretary for IPOC.55 A LinkedIn profile is suggested to exist but was inaccessible.56
Michelle Wieler, Senior Director, Financial Services & Chief Financial Officer 10: Ms. Wieler possesses over 32 years of experience in accounting and finance. She joined Iroquois in 1995 from KPMG Peat Marwick, where she worked in the audit and tax departments. As CFO, she leads and manages the company's accounting, finance, and tax functions, along with insurance risk and property tax management. She is also responsible for external financial stakeholder communications.10 Ms. Wieler represents IPOC on the INGAA FERC Accounting Committee and the INGAA Tax Committee.10 No specific professional LinkedIn profile for Ms. Wieler at Iroquois was found in the provided information; other profiles with similar names were not relevant.
Christopher Stutz, Director, Commercial (effective March 2025) 10: Mr. Stutz has approximately 10 years of experience in the natural gas industry. He rejoined Iroquois in September 2024 as Senior Manager, Gas Control, Scheduling & System Operations, after a period with Rhode Island Energy. He initially joined Iroquois in March 2015 as a Gas Controller and advanced to Chief Controller by 2022. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Technology Management from Excelsior University and a Master of Legal Studies from the University of Oklahoma College of Law. His responsibilities as Director, Commercial include marketing/sales, rates, strategic planning, gas scheduling, and commercial operations initiatives. Mr. Stutz is a member of the NGA Gas Supply Task Force, NGA Gas Control Operating Committee, NGA Gas Operations School, and the INGAA Gas-Electric Task Force.10 No specific professional LinkedIn profile for this Christopher Stutz at Iroquois was found in the provided information.
Other key contacts mentioned include Ruth Parkins (Manager, Government and Stakeholder Relations / Corporate Communications & Public Relations) 8 and Jill Johnson (Communications & Public Relations Specialist).57An information gap exists regarding extensive public speaking engagements or publications for most executives, beyond their significant industry committee involvement or specific testimonies (such as Mr. Amato's Senate testimony). Detailed professional social media presence beyond the inference of LinkedIn profiles is also limited in the available data.
Board of Directors:
As a Limited Partnership, Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. is governed by its partners, TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, rather than a traditional board of directors typical of a publicly traded corporation. The term "Management Committee" is used to describe this governing body. This committee was mentioned by Scott Rupff in his statement upon being appointed President, acknowledging the confidence placed in him by this committee.8 An SEC filing also refers to the Management Committee having approval authority for tax returns and making tax elections by a Super-Majority Vote.60
This Management Committee would be composed of representatives from TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Significant strategic decisions, major capital expenditures (such as the ExC Project), and overall governance would fall under the purview of this committee, reflecting the strategic interests and oversight of the parent companies. Specific names of the individuals serving on the Iroquois Management Committee representing TC Energy and BHE are an information gap in the provided materials.
IT and Security leadership:
The overall responsibility for Security at IPOC is explicitly assigned to Paul R. Amato, the Senior Vice President Operations.10 His portfolio is extensive, also covering Engineering, Environmental, Field Operations, Gas Control Operations, Health & Safety, and Procurement. This indicates a centralized oversight model where security is integrated within the broader operational framework.
The company's Gas Control Monitoring center, located at the Shelton, CT headquarters, utilizes a SCADA system as the core of its operational communications and control. Backup location sites for these critical gas control operations are maintained to ensure redundancy and business continuity.19
The placement of security responsibility under the SVP of Operations is a common organizational structure in critical infrastructure sectors like pipeline operations. In these environments, safety and operational reliability are paramount, and security (both physical and cyber, particularly for OT) is intrinsically linked to these core operational mandates. Mr. Amato's extensive background in operations, engineering, and pipeline safety makes him a logical executive to oversee the security of these critical OT environments.10 The company's public emphasis on "Safe Operation of our System is Priority #1" 9 aligns security leadership directly with operational command. The absence of a prominently featured Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or Chief Information Officer (CIO) at the executive team level on the company's website 10 further suggests that dedicated IT and cybersecurity functions likely report up through the Operations division or another executive branch.
Paul R. Amato is, therefore, the primary executive stakeholder for any engagement related to OT security. Communications and proposals should resonate with operational resilience, safety, and reliability, explicitly linking robust cybersecurity measures to these fundamental business priorities. While Mr. Amato holds the top-level responsibility, identifying his direct reports who manage day-to-day IT, OT, and specific cybersecurity functions will be crucial for detailed engagement.
A significant information gap exists regarding the specific individuals holding titles such as CIO, CISO, CTO, or their direct equivalents, as well as the detailed structure of the IT and cybersecurity teams reporting under Mr. Amato or other executives. Generic searches for such roles did not yield specific Iroquois personnel.61
Middle management in relevant departments:
Beyond the executive team, several individuals in management roles are relevant:
Christopher Stutz, Director, Commercial: Oversees gas scheduling and commercial operations, which interface closely with the operational data from the SCADA system.10
Gas System Controllers: While not management, these roles are critical. They are the primary users of the SCADA system for monitoring pipeline pressures, flows, gas quality, and for responding to emergencies. Their input on operational realities and system usability would be valuable.40 The management overseeing this team would be a key contact.
Tammy Keith, Contracting & ROW Specialist: This individual is listed as a contact for construction bids and contract information.57 Understanding procurement processes for major projects would involve this area.
Russ Riesinger, Senior Procurement and Inventory Management Analyst: This individual is listed as a contact for purchasing.57 The Gas System Controllers and their direct management are pivotal from an OT perspective due to their hands-on interaction with the SCADA systems. The Director of Commercial, while not an IT or security role, is a key internal customer of operational data. Procurement contacts are essential for navigating the vendor engagement and purchasing processes. Information gaps persist regarding specific IT infrastructure managers, security operations managers, network and systems administrators, or dedicated vendor management leadership beyond the general purchasing and contracting contacts provided. Generic searches did not identify these roles at Iroquois.71
Decision-making patterns:
The "Management Committee," representing the parent companies TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, holds significant authority. This committee was cited as placing confidence in the newly appointed President 8 and is responsible for approving federal and state income tax returns and making key tax elections by a Super-Majority Vote.60 This indicates that major strategic and financial decisions, including large capital expenditures for projects like ExC or significant technology investments, would require approval from this Management Committee, aligning with the interests and governance frameworks of the parent entities.
Operational decisions, including those pertaining to technology upgrades and security measures, would likely be driven by the IPOC leadership team (President Scott E. Rupff and SVP Operations Paul R. Amato), who would then seek budget approval and strategic endorsement from the Management Committee.
Detailed information on specific approval processes for technology purchases, defined budget authorities for different leadership levels, and precise financial approval thresholds are not publicly available and represent an information gap.

Key themes emerging from press releases and news coverage include the strategic importance of the ExC project for regional energy reliability, the company's efforts to navigate a complex regulatory and environmental landscape, and the stability indicated by leadership continuity and strong credit ratings. As a privately held entity, Iroquois does not conduct public earnings calls; however, financial stability is consistently reported by credit rating agencies and implied through the activities of its parent companies.[90, 91]


Strategic initiatives:
The strategic direction of Iroquois is largely defined by its efforts to enhance its existing infrastructure to meet demand while addressing environmental concerns.
Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project: This remains the foremost strategic initiative. The project aims to add 125,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity by upgrading compression and gas cooling facilities at its Athens (NY), Dover (NY), Brookfield (CT), and Milford (CT) compressor stations.11 The estimated cost was $272 million as per a 2022 FERC filing.11 The primary beneficiaries are key utility customers Consolidated Edison and National Grid.12 The project has a proposed in-service date of November 1, 2027, and includes the installation of emission reduction equipment, such as Vapor Recovery Systems (VRS), to mitigate environmental impact.12
EPA Methane Challenge Program & Emissions Reduction: Prior to the EPA retiring the Methane Challenge Program in 2024, Iroquois was an active participant (2020-2024). The company committed to a 50% reduction in pipeline venting volume between compressor stations by 2025 and reported surpassing this goal, achieving approximately a 90% reduction during its participation. Methods employed included pipeline pressure reduction before blowdowns, use of transfer compression, and hot taps.36 This demonstrates a proactive approach to managing methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas.
Renewable Electricity Usage: Iroquois has committed to utilizing 100% Certified Renewable Electricity for its Connecticut and New York facilities through the purchase of Green-e® Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).92
Industry Commitments (INGAA): The company has adopted the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America's "2021 Vision Forward: Our Clean Energy Commitments".42 Furthermore, its joint owners (TC Energy, and DT Midstream which is a peer of BHE GT&S and also a Millennium Pipeline owner) are members of the ONE Future Coalition, which aims to voluntarily reduce methane emissions across the natural gas value chain.94
Iroquois is strategically navigating the complexities of the current energy transition. It is investing in traditional natural gas infrastructure enhancements, like the ExC project, to ensure near-term energy reliability for major urban centers. This is driven by persistent demand for natural gas, especially for heating and power generation, as confirmed by utility statements and regulatory bodies acknowledging reliability needs.13 Simultaneously, the company is implementing and prominently highlighting environmental initiatives such as the Methane Challenge participation and the use of renewable electricity for its facilities. These actions aim to align with broader decarbonization goals and address significant pressure from environmental groups and stringent climate mandates like New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).13 The framing of the ExC project as a "compression ONLY" alternative, which avoids the construction of new pipeline mileage, is a strategy to present a less environmentally disruptive path to capacity expansion.12 This dual focus—ensuring reliability through existing asset enhancement while actively managing environmental footprint—is central to Iroquois's current strategy. For NCC Group, this positioning means that cybersecurity solutions, particularly for OT systems critical to the ExC project, can be framed as enabling both reliable and responsible operations. Secure systems are essential to prevent incidents that could lead to environmental damage or supply disruptions, thereby supporting both facets of Iroquois's strategic imperatives. Emphasizing how robust OT security contributes to overall Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives could prove to be a compelling message.
Organizational changes:
The most notable organizational changes have been in leadership:
Leadership Appointments: Scott E. Rupff was appointed President of IPOC, effective January 1, 2025. Paul R. Amato was promoted to Senior Vice President, Operations, and Kimberly Pritchard was promoted to Senior Director, Legal Services & General Counsel, both also effective January 1, 2025.8 Christopher Stutz was appointed Director, Commercial, effective March 2025.10
Retirements: Jeff Bruner, the long-serving President of IPOC, retired on December 31, 2024.8 These changes represent a significant renewal at the highest levels of IPOC's leadership. Such transitions can often create opportunities for new leadership to review and potentially revise existing strategies, operational approaches, vendor relationships, and investment priorities, including those related to technology and security.
Financial developments:
FERC Filings for Negotiated Rates: Throughout early 2025, Iroquois made several filings with FERC for negotiated transportation rates with key shippers, including ConocoPhillips Company, Castleton Commodities Merchant Trading, Emera Energy Services, Inc., and Radiate Energy LLC.85 These filings indicate ongoing commercial activity, contract renewals, and the establishment of new service agreements, reflecting continued demand for its transportation capacity.
S&P Credit Rating Affirmations: S&P Global Ratings consistently affirmed Iroquois's "BBB+" long-term credit rating with a stable outlook in February 2024, May 2024, and again in May 2025.15 This signals sustained financial stability and creditworthiness.
ExC Project Investment & Commitments: The ExC Project represents a substantial capital investment, estimated at $272 million in a 2022 FERC filing.11 As part of the regulatory approvals for the ExC project, Iroquois also committed to investing $5 million to mitigate emissions and reduce environmental burdens in disadvantaged communities.25 The company maintains a stable financial footing, underpinned by long-term contracts and strong parent backing, while concurrently investing significantly in major infrastructure projects like ExC.
Competitive Context
This section analyzes Iroquois Gas Transmission System's position within the competitive natural gas pipeline market of the U.S. Northeast, its industry standing, market challenges, and strategic differentiation.
4. Competitive Landscape
Detailed competitor analysis:
Iroquois operates in a highly competitive and strategically vital energy corridor. Its direct competitors are other major natural gas pipeline systems that serve the Northeast, including New York, Connecticut, and the broader New England region.
Algonquin Gas Transmission (an Enbridge company): This system is a significant competitor, operating extensively in the Northeast and interconnecting with major pipelines like the Texas Eastern Transmission and Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline to serve New England markets.97 Iroquois's SVP Operations, Paul Amato, previously worked at Algonquin.10 The Iroquois interactive map shows an interconnect with Algonquin.35 Algonquin has its own history of expansion projects, such as the Algonquin Incremental Market (AIM) project, Atlantic Bridge, and the more recent "Project Maple" initiative, indicating its continued efforts to enhance capacity in the region.98 It competes with Iroquois in delivering Marcellus-sourced gas into New England.100
Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) (a Kinder Morgan company): TGP is a vast pipeline system that transports natural gas from the Gulf Coast region to the Northeast, including New England.101 It has crucial interconnections with the Iroquois system near Wright, New York, and Stratford, Connecticut.35 Opponents of Iroquois's ExC project have raised concerns about how increased capacity on Iroquois might affect gas draws from connected pipelines like TGP.14 TGP possesses significant transportation capacity and serves many of the same end-markets as Iroquois.
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (Transco) (a Williams company): Transco is one of the largest-volume interstate natural gas transmission systems in the U.S., serving markets from the Gulf Coast up through the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and into the Northeastern states, including the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area.104 Its Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) project is a major ongoing expansion initiative aimed at increasing delivery capacity to this high-demand region.105
Millennium Pipeline: This pipeline operates primarily within New York State, transporting Marcellus and Utica shale gas to markets across New York State and New England.94 It is jointly owned by DT Midstream (majority owner) and TC Energy (which also co-owns Iroquois and operates Millennium). Millennium also interconnects with Iroquois and has been exploring its own capacity expansions to serve New York and New England markets.100
Dominion Energy Transmission (now part of BHE GT&S): While BHE GT&S is a co-owner of Iroquois, the historical assets of Dominion Energy Transmission in the broader Appalachian and Northeast regions represent a significant part of the overall gas transmission infrastructure.28 These assets include extensive pipeline mileage and storage capacity. The interconnectedness means that while under shared ultimate ownership, different pipeline systems within the BHE GT&S portfolio serve distinct and sometimes overlapping market needs. Concerns about gas draws from Dominion-affiliated pipelines were also noted by ExC project opponents.14
The Northeast natural gas market is characterized by a dynamic interplay of supply, demand, and infrastructure constraints. Iroquois, while a key player, operates within a complex web of competing and sometimes complementary pipeline systems. The "race for reliability" is a defining feature of this market. Iroquois and its principal competitors are all actively pursuing expansion projects, predominantly through upgrades to existing systems rather than entirely new "greenfield" pipelines, to address persistent demand. This demand is particularly acute during peak winter heating seasons and for fueling power generation facilities. This simultaneous push for expansion creates an environment of intense competition for regulatory approvals, construction resources, and long-term customer contracts. However, it also underscores a degree of interdependence, as these major pipeline systems are frequently interconnected.4 Expansions on one system can influence, and may need to be coordinated with, operations on others. For example, Iroquois's ExC project is designed with an awareness of its role in the broader regional supply network, and the capacity it offers is sought by LDCs that may also receive gas from competing pipelines. The significant challenges and public opposition associated with constructing new pipelines from scratch 80 mean that leveraging and expanding existing rights-of-way and compressor station footprints is the primary avenue for growth and competition. For NCC Group, this focus on reliability across an interconnected grid is a key consideration. A security incident on any single major pipeline, including Iroquois, could have cascading impacts on regional energy stability. This allows NCC Group to position its OT security solutions not only as a means to protect Iroquois's specific assets but also as a contribution to the overall resilience and reliability of the Northeast energy network—a critical concern for regulators, customers, and the public. The competitive drive to maintain operational efficiency and prevent costly downtime further strengthens the business case for proactive investments in security measures designed to avert incidents.
Market position relative to competitors:
Iroquois positions itself as "the premier natural gas transmission system serving the Northeast" on its corporate website.9 This claim is supported by S&P Global Ratings, which assesses Iroquois's competitive position as "Strong".16 In terms of market penetration, Iroquois reported transporting approximately 30% of the natural gas consumed in Connecticut and 16% of that consumed in New York during 2023.42 Historically, its firm transportation capacity into Connecticut and the New York metropolitan area has been highly subscribed, reportedly at 100% during the winter of 2014 100, and it was fully subscribed for winter 2024-2025 operations.81 These figures indicate that Iroquois is a substantial and critical supplier in its core operational states. However, it is not the sole provider; competitors like TGP and Transco transport significant volumes from other supply basins, such as the Gulf Coast and the Appalachian region. The market is defined by consistently high demand, especially during peak winter periods, and recognized capacity constraints, which motivates all major pipeline operators to actively pursue expansion projects.

The primary executive target should be Paul R. Amato, Senior Vice President Operations. His explicit and overarching responsibility for "Security," in addition to all other operational aspects including Gas Control Operations and Engineering, positions him as the key decision-maker and budget holder for OT security initiatives.10
Secondary targets would include direct reports to Mr. Amato who are responsible for the day-to-day management of Gas Control, SCADA systems, pipeline engineering, and field operations. Identifying the Manager of Gas Control or equivalent would be particularly valuable.
Scott E. Rupff, President, should be kept informed, especially for larger strategic engagements, but initial technical discussions are likely best directed at Mr. Amato's level.
Kimberly Pritchard, Sr. Director, Legal Services & General Counsel (and Chief Compliance Officer), may become involved if discussions pertain to regulatory compliance, risk management frameworks, or contractual agreements.10
Organizational Entry Points:
Leverage Mr. Amato's significant industry involvement (e.g., INGAA, NGA, Siemens User Group) as a potential entry point through industry events or mutual connections.10
The ongoing Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project represents a major organizational focus and a period of significant OT system change. This project provides a natural entry point to discuss the security of new and integrated control systems.11
Procurement contacts (Tammy Keith for construction/contracts, Russ Riesinger for general purchasing 57) can provide insights into vendor approval processes, although strategic engagement should start higher.
Relationship-Building Strategy:
Focus on building a trusted advisor relationship by demonstrating a deep understanding of the natural gas transmission industry, its operational challenges, and its specific regulatory environment (FERC, TSA pipeline security).
Highlight NCC Group's expertise in OT cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, emphasizing experience with SCADA and ICS environments similar to Iroquois's.
Acknowledge and align with Iroquois's strong safety and reliability culture. Position cybersecurity as an enabler of these core values.
Communication Approach Aligned with Organizational Culture:
Communications should be professional, factual, and data-driven, reflecting the engineering and operational focus of the likely audience.
Emphasize risk reduction, operational resilience, safety enhancement, and compliance assurance.
Use clear, concise language, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible, but be prepared to discuss technical details deeply with relevant engineering and operations staff.
Reference Iroquois's public commitments to safety, environmental responsibility, and reliability, and explain how NCC Group's services support these commitments.
Timing Considerations Based on Organizational Cycle:
The ExC Project timeline (ongoing, with a 2027 in-service target 12) provides a multi-year window for engagement at different project phases (design, implementation, commissioning, operation).
The recent leadership transitions (effective January 2025 8) may mean that the new leadership team is currently reviewing strategies and vendor relationships, potentially creating an opportune time for introducing new solutions or perspectives in early to mid-2025.
Budget cycles are not explicitly known but are likely influenced by parent company fiscal calendars. Engagement leading up to annual or project-specific budgeting periods would be strategic.
Understanding the influence of parent companies, TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, on Iroquois's technology standards, cybersecurity policies, and major investment decisions will be crucial. Engagement strategies may benefit from researching the parent companies' approaches to OT security and their existing relationships with cybersecurity service providers.

GTM Analysis Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP
This second part of the GTM analysis delves into the technical infrastructure and security posture of Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP. It aims to provide NCC Group's sales team with a detailed understanding of Iroquois's technology stack, operational technology (OT) environment, security history, vendor relationships, and technical challenges.
Executive Summary
Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP operates a sophisticated and critical technical environment to manage its 414-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. Central to this is a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, which provides 24/7/365 monitoring and remote control of compressor stations, meter stations, and mainline valves from its primary gas control center in Shelton, CT, with backup facilities for redundancy.19 The ongoing Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project involves significant OT upgrades, including new turbines and control systems at multiple compressor stations, indicating a period of technological evolution.11
Security is a stated priority, with oversight falling under the Senior Vice President of Operations, Paul R. Amato, highlighting an operations-centric approach to security management.10 The company maintains a robust Public Awareness Program and implements various measures for pipeline integrity and physical safety.42 However, publicly available information lacks specific details regarding dedicated cybersecurity frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISA/IEC 62443), a distinct cybersecurity leadership structure beyond operational oversight (like a CISO), or recent cyber-specific incidents.
Critical technical challenges likely include managing the security and reliability of an aging infrastructure (operational since 1992 1) while integrating new technologies associated with projects like ExC. Ensuring the cybersecurity of extensive and geographically dispersed SCADA and OT systems against a backdrop of increasing threats to critical infrastructure is a paramount concern. Meeting stringent and evolving regulatory requirements, such as those from the TSA, also presents an ongoing challenge.
The current vendor landscape, particularly for security, is not extensively detailed in public sources. A notable relationship exists with Siemens, particularly concerning their SGT400 turbines and associated control systems used in compressor stations.10 Information on other specific IT, OT, or cybersecurity vendors is limited.
Primary security threats and risks for Iroquois align with those facing the broader natural gas pipeline sector. These include cyberattacks targeting Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and SCADA environments, which could lead to operational disruptions, significant safety incidents, and environmental damage. Ransomware attacks targeting corporate IT systems with potential spillover to OT, and sophisticated persistent threats from nation-state actors or cybercriminals targeting critical infrastructure, are key risks that necessitate a robust and specialized security posture.
Technology Infrastructure Analysis
This section details Iroquois Gas Transmission System's technology stack, with a particular focus on its Operational Technology (OT) environment, digital transformation efforts, and infrastructure challenges.
1. Technology Infrastructure
Detailed technology stack analysis:
Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, etc.): Specific Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems utilized by Iroquois are not publicly identified in the available information. Given its operational scale and status as a subsidiary of major corporations like TC Energy and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, it is highly probable that Iroquois employs established ERP systems for core business functions such as finance, human resources, and procurement. The use of a sophisticated CRM system might be less extensive, considering Iroquois's business model primarily involves transporting gas for a relatively small number of large-volume shippers rather than managing a large customer base. An information gap exists regarding the specific ERP and CRM solutions in use.
Cloud services and providers in use: There is no specific mention in the available data of Iroquois utilizing major cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its core operations or enterprise IT. While critical OT and SCADA systems in the pipeline industry are often maintained on-premise for enhanced security, control, and regulatory compliance, Iroquois might leverage cloud services for corporate IT functions, data analytics, disaster recovery, or other non-critical support applications. The industry trend shows cautious but growing adoption of cloud technologies, particularly for OT-adjacent data processing and analytics. An information gap exists regarding Iroquois's specific cloud adoption strategy and service providers.
Network architecture (if publicly known): The SCADA system, which forms the backbone of Iroquois's operational control, relies on "redundant communication methods" to ensure high availability and resilience.19 This suggests a robust network architecture designed for continuous SCADA data transmission. Such networks in the pipeline industry typically utilize a combination of owned infrastructure (like fiber optic cables along the right-of-way or microwave links) and leased telecommunication lines, potentially including satellite communications for remote or hard-to-reach locations. A critical aspect of this architecture would be network segmentation, particularly isolating the OT network (controlling pipeline operations) from the corporate IT network to prevent threats from propagating. Specific details of Iroquois's network architecture, the technologies employed (e.g., MPLS, SD-WAN), and the specifics of their IT/OT segmentation strategies are an information gap.
Data center locations and capabilities: The primary Gas Control Monitoring center is situated at Iroquois's corporate headquarters in Shelton, Connecticut. Crucially, the company maintains "backup location sites for gas control operations" to ensure operational continuity in the event the primary site becomes inaccessible.19 This indicates a disaster recovery and business continuity plan involving at least one primary data center/control room and one or more geographically separate backup/DR sites for SCADA and other critical operational systems. The specific locations and technical capabilities of these backup data centers are an information gap.
Hardware and software vendors: A significant known vendor relationship is with Siemens, particularly for their SGT400 combustion turbines used in Iroquois's compressor stations. Paul Amato, SVP Operations, notably chairs the Siemens SGT400 International Users Group, indicating a deep and strategic engagement with Siemens technology.10 The Enhancement by Compression (ExC) Project involves the installation of new gas-fired turbine compressor units and associated gas cooling equipment 11; while the specific vendors for these new systems are not named in the provided data, they would be major industrial equipment manufacturers. Information gaps exist regarding the primary SCADA system vendor (e.g., Schneider Electric, Emerson, Honeywell, Rockwell Automation), other key OT system vendors (PLCs, RTUs), and principal enterprise IT hardware and software suppliers.
Legacy systems and modernization efforts: Having commenced operations in 1992 1, it is reasonable to assume that Iroquois's infrastructure includes some legacy systems, particularly within its OT environment. The ongoing ExC Project represents a significant modernization effort, specifically targeting upgrades and new technology installations at existing compressor stations.11 This project focuses on enhancing specific operational components rather than a complete overhaul of the entire OT infrastructure. This incremental modernization approach, while pragmatic from a cost and operational disruption standpoint, introduces complexities. Integrating new, often more interconnected, technologies with potentially older, existing systems creates intricate cybersecurity challenges, particularly at the points of interface between new and legacy equipment. These integration points can become inadvertent pathways for cyber threats if not meticulously secured. The pipeline's long operational history makes it probable that some original or early-generation control system components may still be in service in parts of the system not directly affected by the ExC project. The strategy of enhancing existing assets, as seen with the "compression ONLY" focus of ExC 12, likely extends to control systems where feasible, leading to a heterogeneous OT environment composed of both modern and aging technologies. This mixed environment requires careful security management to address vulnerabilities that may exist in older components while ensuring that new systems are deployed securely and do not introduce new risks to the established infrastructure. NCC Group's expertise in assessing the security of such integration points, applying secure-by-design principles for new OT deployments (like those in the ExC project), and managing the risks inherent in mixed-technology OT environments would be highly relevant.
Operational Technology (OT) environments:
Iroquois's operations are heavily dependent on a sophisticated OT environment to manage its natural gas transmission pipeline safely and efficiently.
Industrial control systems in use: The core of Iroquois's OT environment is its SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. This system is described as the "backbone of the gas control center's communications" and is utilized for data collection, continuous monitoring, and remote operation of critical pipeline assets, including compressor stations, meter stations, and mainline valves.19 A job posting for Gas System Controllers further details the use of SCADA to monitor gas pressures, flows, and quality, and to control the pipeline system, which includes 7 compressor stations and 24 meter stations.40 Compressor stations are also equipped with "advanced fail-safe controls and monitoring capabilities" 42, indicating layers of automated control and safety systems. The paramount importance of these ICS, particularly the SCADA system, to Iroquois's core business functions means their security is non-negotiable.
SCADA systems and protocols: While the use of SCADA is confirmed, specific details such as the SCADA system vendor, the software versions in use, and the primary industrial communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3, OPC, or proprietary protocols) employed across the network are not publicly detailed and represent an information gap. Given the pipeline system's age, it is possible that a mix of legacy and more modern communication protocols are in use, each with its own set of security considerations and potential vulnerabilities.
Manufacturing execution systems (MES): Traditional MES as found in discrete manufacturing are less likely to be a standalone system in a pipeline context. However, Iroquois would have systems for managing gas nominations, scheduling (a responsibility of the Commercial team under Director Christopher Stutz 10), and tracking gas quality. These functions could be integrated with or adjacent to the SCADA and operational data systems, requiring secure data exchange.
Building automation systems (BAS): BAS are likely deployed at key facilities such as compressor stations and the corporate headquarters in Shelton for managing HVAC, physical access control, and other building environmental systems. While often considered separate from industrial process controls, BAS can pose security risks if they are connected to broader corporate or operational networks without adequate segmentation and hardening. Specific BAS vendors or details of their integration with other networks are an information gap.
IoT deployments and connected devices: The ExC Project, with its installation of new compression machinery and gas cooling systems 11, will invariably introduce modern sensors, actuators, and controllers. Many of these new components could be classified as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, offering enhanced monitoring and control capabilities but also potentially expanding the cyber-attack surface if not securely implemented and managed. A formal strategy or specific IoT platforms being adopted by Iroquois are not publicly known.
OT/IT convergence initiatives: Although not explicitly stated as a formal initiative, the operational need for data from OT systems (like SCADA) to inform business decision-making processes (e.g., commercial operations, efficiency analysis, regulatory reporting) implies a degree of data exchange between the OT and IT environments. The security of these OT/IT convergence points is a critical concern, as they can become vectors for threats to propagate from the IT network to the sensitive OT environment if not properly architected and protected. Details on a formal OT/IT convergence strategy or a specific governance model for managing these interactions are an information gap.
Digital transformation initiatives:
Iroquois's careers page mentions "embracing innovative technologies to position natural gas as a major player in the advancement of renewable energy".115 This suggests a forward-looking perspective on technology adoption. In the context of a pipeline operator, digital transformation is less likely to be focused on customer-facing digital products and more on leveraging data and digital tools for operational efficiency, predictive maintenance, enhanced safety protocols, environmental compliance, and improved decision-making. The ExC Project itself, with its focus on deploying advanced compression technology and sophisticated emission reduction equipment 12, can be viewed as a significant component of an operational transformation strategy. However, specific digital transformation roadmaps, dedicated innovation labs or centers, or publicly announced strategic technology partnerships beyond those with operational equipment vendors (like Siemens) are not detailed in the available information.
Infrastructure challenges:
Based on the nature of its operations and industry trends, Iroquois likely faces several infrastructure challenges:
Aging Infrastructure: With operations commencing in 1992, some parts of the pipeline and associated control systems are aging, necessitating robust integrity management programs and eventual modernization or replacement.
Cybersecurity of Dispersed OT Assets: Securing a geographically extensive network of critical OT assets (compressor stations, meter stations, valves) across New York and Connecticut against evolving cyber threats is a constant challenge.
Integration of New and Legacy Technologies: The ExC project involves integrating modern OT systems into an existing infrastructure, which can create technical and security complexities at the interface points.
Regulatory Compliance: Meeting and maintaining compliance with increasingly stringent cybersecurity regulations for critical infrastructure, such as those issued by the TSA for pipelines, is an ongoing effort.
Ensuring High Reliability: Maintaining the high levels of operational reliability (>99% claimed 9) in the face of potential physical hazards and cyber threats requires continuous vigilance and investment. Publicly stated specific legacy system issues, formal technical debt statements, or particular scaling challenges beyond the capacity increase addressed by the ExC project are not available in the provided information.

Security Posture Assessment
This section evaluates Iroquois Gas Transmission System's security posture and history, based on publicly available information regarding incidents, program elements, investments, and its general vulnerability profile.
2. Security Posture and History
Security incident history:
There is no information in the provided public sources detailing any specific cybersecurity breaches, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities directly attributed to Iroquois, regulatory findings related to cybersecurity lapses, or security-related litigation or settlements involving Iroquois Gas Transmission System. This absence of public information is common for operators of critical infrastructure, as such incidents are often handled discreetly unless mandatory disclosure is required. It does not definitively mean no incidents have occurred.
Current security program elements:
Iroquois's approach to security appears deeply integrated with its operational safety culture and regulatory compliance obligations.
Leadership Oversight: The overall direction of Security is a responsibility of Paul R. Amato, the Senior Vice President of Operations.10 This placement suggests that security is viewed through an operational lens, prioritizing the safety and reliability of pipeline functions.
Safety as a Core Tenet: The company prominently states, "Safe Operation of our System is Priority #1" 9, indicating that safety is a foundational element of its security considerations.
Public Awareness and Emergency Response: Iroquois maintains a comprehensive Public Awareness Program. This program disseminates pipeline safety information to residents, businesses, local public officials, and emergency responders, covering hazard recognition and emergency procedures.48 This indicates a proactive stance on community safety and preparedness.
Pipeline Integrity Management: A robust pipeline integrity management program is in place. This includes weekly aerial or ground patrols of the pipeline right-of-way, internal pipeline inspections that reportedly exceed federal requirements, cathodic protection systems to prevent corrosion, leak surveys, continuous pressure monitoring, and odorization of the natural gas for leak detection.13 These measures are primarily focused on physical integrity and safety.
Contractor Safety Requirements: Contractors working on Iroquois property or rights-of-way are required to adhere to stringent safety protocols, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) drug and alcohol testing program requirements (49 CFR Part 199) and FERC Standards of Conduct.37
Operational Monitoring and Control: The Gas Control Monitoring center operates 24/7/365, utilizing the SCADA system for continuous oversight. Backup control sites are maintained to ensure operational resilience.19
Regulatory Compliance: Iroquois adheres to DOT regulations, particularly concerning Control Room Management (49 CFR 192.631) and the DOT Operator Qualification Program for Gas System Operations staff.40 Iroquois clearly demonstrates a strong, safety-driven security culture, with a heavy emphasis on physical integrity, adherence to operational procedures, and compliance with relevant industry regulations, primarily from DOT and FERC. This is evident from their extensive physical safety and integrity management programs 13 and the operational background of key leadership like Paul Amato, under whom "Security" resides.10 However, the publicly available information does not provide explicit details about a formalized, contemporary cybersecurity program specifically tailored for OT environments. There is no mention of dedicated cybersecurity leadership roles, such as a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reporting outside of the direct operational chain of command, nor is there public information on the adoption of common cybersecurity frameworks like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001 (for IT governance), or, critically for their sector, ISA/IEC 62443 for OT security.10 While Iroquois is undoubtedly security-conscious from a physical safety and regulatory compliance perspective, this lack of explicit information on a distinct OT cybersecurity program presents a potential area for maturation. NCC Group could assist by introducing concepts from ISA/IEC 62443, conducting specialized OT cyber risk assessments, and helping to bridge any existing gaps between their robust physical/safety security measures and dedicated cyber defenses for their industrial control systems. The existing strong safety culture can serve as an excellent foundation upon which to build an equally strong cybersecurity culture. An information gap exists regarding specific cybersecurity frameworks implemented (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001, ISA/IEC 62443), documented cybersecurity policies, cybersecurity-specific certifications achieved by the organization, and the detailed structure of any dedicated cybersecurity team.
Security investments and initiatives:
The ExC Project includes the "Installation of Emission Reduction Equipment at Project Sites" 12 and Vapor Recovery Systems.14 While these are primarily environmental initiatives, they relate to the secure and controlled operation of new and modified facilities, implying that security considerations would be part of their design and implementation. Investments in security are likely embedded within broader operational integrity, safety, and capital project budgets. The ExC project, by its nature involving new OT systems, would necessitate security reviews and investments to protect these new assets and their integration points. However, publicly announced initiatives or budget allocations specifically dedicated to cybersecurity, or executive statements focused solely on cybersecurity priorities, are not found in the provided information.
Vulnerability profile:
There are no known vulnerabilities specific to Iroquois Gas Transmission System, findings from security researchers targeting Iroquois, public vulnerability disclosures made by or about Iroquois, or mentions of bug bounty programs or third-party security assessment results in the provided public data. This is not unusual for a private operator of critical national infrastructure. However, the natural gas pipeline industry as a whole, and the types of technologies Iroquois employs (such as ICS/SCADA systems and specific industrial hardware like Siemens turbines), are subject to known classes of vulnerabilities that would generally apply. Proactive vulnerability management and regular assessments would be crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
Current Vendor Relationships
This section outlines known and inferred vendor relationships of Iroquois Gas Transmission System, particularly those relevant to its technical and security infrastructure.
3. Current Vendor Relationships
Security vendor ecosystem:
Publicly available information on Iroquois's specific security vendor ecosystem is limited. The most prominent technology vendor relationship indicated is with Siemens, particularly concerning their SGT400 combustion turbines and, by extension, the associated control systems used in Iroquois's compressor stations. Paul R. Amato, SVP Operations, holds the position of Chair of the Siemens SGT400 International Users Group, which signifies a deep and strategic relationship with Siemens for this critical OT component.10
Beyond Siemens for OT components, specific security service providers, technology vendors for cybersecurity solutions (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM), Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs), cybersecurity consultants, or system integrators specializing in security are not publicly named in the provided information. It is highly probable that Iroquois utilizes a range of IT security vendors for its corporate systems, but these are not disclosed.
Vendor relationship history:
The length of current vendor relationships (other than the implied long-term engagement with major OT equipment suppliers like Siemens), public statements by Iroquois regarding vendor satisfaction, any published case studies featuring Iroquois as a customer of a security vendor, joint press releases or announcements with security vendors, or executive testimonials for such vendors are not available in the provided data.
Contract information (if public):
Specific details such as known contract renewal dates for security products or services, the monetary values of such contracts, or defined procurement patterns specifically for security solutions are not publicly disclosed. General procurement contacts are Tammy Keith (Contracting & ROW Specialist, for construction bids/contracts) and Russ Riesinger (Senior Procurement and Inventory Management Analyst, for general purchasing).57 These individuals would likely be involved in the procurement process for security-related acquisitions, but the strategic selection of security vendors would involve operational and technical leadership.
Technical Pain Points and Challenges
This section identifies publicly acknowledged and inferred technical and security-specific challenges faced by Iroquois Gas Transmission System.
4. Technical Pain Points and Challenges
Publicly acknowledged technical issues:
The provided public information does not contain explicit acknowledgments from Iroquois regarding specific system performance problems, integration difficulties (though the ExC project inherently involves complex integration), scalability concerns beyond the capacity expansion addressed by ExC, acute reliability issues (the company claims >99% reliability 9), or widespread compatibility problems with its technology stack. Pipeline operators are generally reticent about publicizing such issues unless they result in reportable incidents or service disruptions.
Security-specific challenges (inferred):
Based on industry knowledge and the nature of Iroquois's operations, several security-specific challenges can be inferred:
Securing Legacy and Modern OT Systems: Managing the cybersecurity risks of aging OT components (given operations since 1992) alongside the introduction of new technologies through projects like ExC creates a complex, heterogeneous environment that can be challenging to secure uniformly.
Maintaining OT Network Visibility: Achieving and maintaining comprehensive visibility across a geographically distributed OT network spanning 414 miles, with numerous remote stations, is a significant challenge for monitoring and incident response.
Threat Landscape for Critical Infrastructure: Protecting against an evolving and increasingly sophisticated array of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure, including ransomware and state-sponsored actors, requires continuous adaptation and investment in advanced security measures.
Regulatory Compliance for Cybersecurity: Adhering to evolving cybersecurity regulations and directives for the pipeline sector, such as those from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), demands ongoing effort and resources.
OT Cybersecurity Skills Gap: The specialized nature of OT cybersecurity often leads to a skills gap in the industry. With a relatively lean employee base 33, Iroquois may face challenges in recruiting and retaining specialized OT cybersecurity talent, potentially increasing reliance on external expertise. No explicit public statements from Iroquois detailing security skills gaps, specific resource constraints for cybersecurity, issues with security tool proliferation, or particular struggles with cybersecurity compliance were found in the provided information.
Industry-specific technical challenges:
The natural gas transmission industry, including Iroquois, grapples with several inherent technical challenges:
Pipeline Integrity and Safety: Ensuring the physical integrity of hundreds of miles of pipeline, preventing leaks, and managing public safety in proximity to these assets are paramount and ongoing technical challenges.
Meeting Peak Demand in Constrained Regions: The Northeast U.S. is known for its high energy demand, especially during winter peaks, and existing pipeline capacity is often constrained. Projects like ExC are direct responses to this challenge.13
Adapting to the Energy Transition: The broader shift towards cleaner energy sources and decarbonization goals puts pressure on natural gas infrastructure operators to improve efficiency, reduce emissions (like methane), and demonstrate their role in a lower-carbon future.
Executive statements on challenges:
While Iroquois executives do not publicly detail "pain points" in a problem-oriented manner, their statements consistently emphasize the importance of meeting the evolving energy needs of the Northeast, ensuring operational safety and reliability, and fulfilling their environmental commitments.8 The entire strategic impetus behind the ExC project can be interpreted as a direct response to the challenge of insufficient capacity to meet projected demand reliably. Any factor that threatens these core objectives—safety, reliability, environmental compliance, and meeting contractual obligations—would constitute a significant challenge and pain point for the leadership.

Security Threat Alignment
Iroquois Gas Transmission System, as an operator of critical natural gas pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. Northeast, faces a threat landscape common to the energy sector and specifically to entities with extensive Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The primary threats are those that could disrupt operations, compromise safety, lead to environmental incidents, or result in significant financial and reputational damage.
Mapping of organization's profile to likely threats:
Critical Infrastructure Designation: Being a key natural gas supplier to densely populated areas like New York City and parts of Connecticut makes Iroquois an attractive target for actors seeking to cause widespread disruption.
Reliance on SCADA/ICS: The core of their operations depends on SCADA systems for remote monitoring and control of pipelines, compressor stations, and valves.19 These systems are historically known targets for sophisticated cyberattacks.
OT/IT Convergence: The necessary data exchange between OT and IT environments, however minimal or secured, creates potential pathways for threats to move from the corporate network to the control systems network if not adequately protected.
Geographically Dispersed Assets: Managing security across 414 miles of pipeline and numerous remote stations presents challenges for physical security and rapid cyber incident response.
Legacy Systems Potential: Given the age of the system (operational since 1992 1), there's a possibility of legacy OT components that may lack modern security features or have unpatched vulnerabilities.
Third-Party Risks: Reliance on vendors for equipment (e.g., Siemens turbines 10) and potentially for specialized maintenance or project work introduces supply chain risks and risks from third-party remote access.
Insider Threats: Malicious or unintentional actions by employees or contractors with access to critical systems remain a persistent threat.
Connection to threat actors (General Industry Context):
While no specific threat actors targeting Iroquois are named in the snippets, the oil and gas sector, particularly pipeline operators, is a known target for various threat actor groups identified in broader cybersecurity reports (such as those from Dragos, CISA, etc.). These typically include:
State-Sponsored Actors: Nations seeking to gain intelligence, establish persistence for future disruptive attacks, or demonstrate cyber power against critical infrastructure of adversaries. The energy sector is a prime target for such activities.
Cybercriminals (Ransomware Groups): Ransomware attacks have increasingly targeted industrial organizations. While often initially hitting IT systems, there's a risk of operational disruption if OT systems are impacted directly or indirectly (e.g., loss of view or control due to IT system compromise).
Hacktivists: Groups motivated by political or environmental agendas might target energy companies to make a statement or disrupt operations they oppose. The strong environmental opposition to the ExC project 13 could, in a hypothetical scenario, motivate such actors, though there is no indication of this in the current data.
ICS-Specific Malware Developers: Groups that develop specialized malware (e.g., TRITON, Industroyer, PIPEDREAM) capable of directly interacting with and manipulating industrial control systems pose a severe threat, although these are typically associated with highly sophisticated state-level actors.
Industry-specific threat landscape:
The natural gas pipeline industry faces threats such as:
Attacks aimed at disrupting gas flow, leading to supply shortages, particularly during peak demand.
Manipulation of control systems leading to overpressure, leaks, explosions, or equipment damage.
Compromise of safety instrumented systems (SIS), potentially leading to catastrophic failures.
Theft of sensitive operational data or commercially valuable information.
Attacks on gas scheduling and nomination systems, disrupting the commercial operations of the pipeline.
Attack surface analysis (high-level):
