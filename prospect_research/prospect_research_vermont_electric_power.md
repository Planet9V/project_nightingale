This report provides the first part of a comprehensive Go-to-Market (GTM) analysis for NCC Group's sales team, focusing on developing a detailed understanding of Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO)'s organizational structure, leadership, and broader context. The objective is to distill actionable intelligence that will directly inform and enhance NCC Group's engagement strategy.
Executive Summary
Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO) is recognized as the nation's pioneering statewide, "transmission-only" electric power company, established in 1956.1 In its capacity as Vermont's grid operator, VELCO's fundamental mission centers on ensuring the safe, reliable, and cost-effective transmission of electric power throughout the state, seamlessly integrating with the broader New England regional network.1 This critical role extends to maintaining electricity availability even during periods of peak demand, severe weather, and unforeseen events.1
A distinctive characteristic of VELCO is its corporate structure: a for-profit entity that operates with a unique cooperative-like financial model. This arrangement dictates that any generated value is returned to its owners—comprising Vermont's 17 local electric distribution utilities and the Vermont Low-Income Trust for Electricity (VLITE)—and, by extension, their customers.3 This structure underscores a primary commitment to public benefit rather than conventional shareholder profit maximization. The company's operational backbone includes an extensive infrastructure network, encompassing 740 miles of transmission lines, 55 substations, and a 1,500-mile fiber optic network.6
The executive leadership team is spearheaded by President & CEO Thomas Dunn, with key support from figures such as Dan Nelson, Vice President of Technology; Michele C. Nelson, Chief Financial Officer; Michael Fiske, Chief Operating Officer; and Cheryl Mullins, Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer.8 The Board of Directors reflects the company's unique ownership, with representation from its utility owners and public benefit entities, ensuring diverse stakeholder perspectives in governance.3
Recent strategic developments highlight VELCO's proactive stance on digital transformation and grid modernization. A significant initiative includes the launch of its enhanced Point of Interconnection (POI) Heat Map in March 2025, an interactive tool designed to streamline the integration of distributed generation resources across Vermont.10 Furthermore, the 2024 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report details ongoing infrastructure modernization efforts, such as the commissioning of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and comprehensive fleet electrification programs.4 Recent leadership appointments, including Dan Nelson's promotion to VP of Technology and Mark Sciarrotta's designation as Chief Compliance Officer, further emphasize the company's strategic focus on technology and regulatory adherence.12
Given its singular role as a statewide transmission-only utility, VELCO does not engage in direct market competition in the traditional sense. Its operational environment is instead characterized by a focus on maintaining operational excellence, adhering to stringent regulatory standards—particularly NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) requirements—and effectively adapting to evolving energy demands, including the integration of clean energy sources within the broader New England regional grid.14 This distinct ownership model and public benefit mission position VELCO as a critical, collaborative partner to its owners and the state, rather than a market rival.
VELCO's unique ownership structure and public benefit mission fundamentally shape its strategic priorities and investment decisions. As a for-profit corporation designed to deliver cooperative benefits, with its ownership vested in local distribution utilities and a public benefit corporation, the company's financial and operational choices are primarily driven by considerations of long-term reliability, cost-effectiveness for ratepayers, and alignment with Vermont's overarching sustainability objectives.3 This contrasts sharply with typical investor-owned utilities, which often prioritize quarterly shareholder returns. Consequently, any engagement with VELCO should emphasize how proposed solutions contribute directly to enhancing grid reliability, mitigating costly outages (thereby reducing financial burdens on ratepayers), ensuring rigorous compliance with critical regulations such as NERC CIP, and actively supporting Vermont's transition towards a cleaner energy future. A collaborative, partnership-oriented approach that resonates with VELCO's public benefit mandate is therefore essential for successful engagement.
Organizational Profile
Full Legal Name and Corporate Structure
Vermont Electric Power Company, officially known as VELCO, serves as the singular owner and operator of all electrical transmission assets within the state of Vermont.1 Structurally, VELCO is a for-profit corporation 3, yet it operates under a distinctive financial model designed to return value directly to its owners—a consortium of Vermont's 17 local electric distribution utilities and the Vermont Low-Income Trust for Electricity (VLITE), which functions as a public benefit corporation.4 This unique ownership arrangement underpins VELCO's commitment to public service and ratepayer benefit.
The corporate architecture includes key subsidiary relationships. Vermont Electric Transmission Company (VETCO), a wholly-owned subsidiary of VELCO, was established in 1982. Its primary purpose was the construction and operation of the Vermont segment of the Phase I Quebec-New England High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Interconnection, a vital transmission line authorized by the Vermont Public Utility Commission.2 Furthermore, in 2006, VELCO collaborated with Vermont's electric distribution companies to form Vermont Transco LLC. While Vermont Transco LLC holds ownership of Vermont's high-voltage electric transmission system (operating at 115 kV and above), VELCO retains the critical responsibility for managing and operating this extensive system.2 This operational distinction is particularly relevant for understanding financial reporting, as a significant portion of the publicly available financial data pertains directly to VT Transco LLC.
While explicit formal business units are not extensively detailed in public records, the composition of VELCO's executive leadership team provides insight into its functional divisions. These implicitly include areas such as Engineering, Technology, Human Resources, Legal Affairs, Communications, Operations, Safety, Planning, and Transmission Services, reflecting the diverse expertise required to manage a complex utility infrastructure.8 No broad, recent restructuring initiatives beyond these historical formations have been publicly announced.
VELCO's merger and acquisition history reveals a notable transaction around 2011-2012. This involved Gaz Metro LP's indirect acquisition of Central Vermont Public Service (CVPS) and its subsequent merger with Green Mountain Power (GMP). This event triggered a change in majority ownership of Vermont Transco LLC and a shift in over 10% of VELCO's equity.18 A crucial component of this agreement was the conveyance of approximately 33% of the common equity in VELCO from CVPS and GMP to VLITE, the public benefit corporation. This strategic move ensured that the newly merged entity would not gain majority ownership of VELCO, thereby reinforcing VELCO's commitment to its unique, publicly-beneficial ownership model and its accountability to a broader set of stakeholders.18 This historical context highlights the highly regulated environment in which VELCO operates and its dedication to maintaining a public-service oriented structure.
Year Founded, Headquarters Location, and Significant Operational Locations
VELCO was established in 1956, marking its inception as a pioneering entity in the electric transmission sector.1 The company's headquarters are situated in Rutland, Vermont, at 366 Pinnacle Ridge Road, Rutland, VT 05701.3 In addition to its main headquarters, VELCO maintains an office in Montpelier, located at 1 Blanchard Court, Montpelier, VT 05602.3
VELCO's operational footprint is extensive across Vermont. Its infrastructure includes 55 substations, switching stations, and terminal facilities distributed throughout the state.3 The company also manages approximately 13,000 acres of rights-of-way, essential for its transmission lines.6 A critical component of its operational network is a 1,500-mile fiber optic system, which serves both to monitor and control the electric grid and to provide broadband services.6 Furthermore, VELCO operates a statewide emergency radio system, enhancing its ability to respond to grid events.6 Recent infrastructure developments include the New Haven Operations Facility, which functions as a backup control center and a secondary data center, bolstering operational resilience.7 Specific substations, such as Barre, and radio sites in Richford and Montgomery, are also key operational points, particularly in relation to recent Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) initiatives.4
Industry Classification and Primary Business Activities
VELCO is classified within the Electric Power Transmission industry.1 Its primary business activity is the management of the safe, reliable, and cost-effective transmission of electric power throughout Vermont, operating as an integral component of the interconnected New England regional network.1 This involves the comprehensive responsibility of building, operating, and maintaining the state's electric transmission facilities.3 It is important to note that VELCO does not directly provide electricity to individual homes or businesses; instead, it delivers power to local distribution companies, which then serve the end consumers.19
For standardized industry classification, VELCO is assigned the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 221121, which corresponds to Electric Bulk Power Transmission and Control.20 Its Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 49119903, specifically for Transmission, Electric Power.20 These classifications underscore its specialized role within the broader energy sector.
Precise Company Size Metrics
Analysis of VELCO's financial and employee size metrics reveals a consistent growth trajectory and a strategic approach to resource allocation.
Annual Revenue (3-year trend): While direct revenue figures for VELCO are not explicitly provided, financial data for VT Transco LLC, which VELCO manages, offers a clear picture of the scale of operations. The total operating revenues for VT Transco LLC show a steady increase:
2021 Budget: $216,715,000 21
2022 Budget: $225,043,000 21
2023 Budget: $230,723,000 22
2023 Forecast: $231,415,000 22
2024 Budget: $240,776,000 22 This consistent upward trend in revenue, from approximately $216.7 million in 2021 to a budgeted $240.7 million in 2024, signifies a stable and expanding financial foundation. This financial stability supports ongoing investments in infrastructure and operational enhancements.
Employee Count: Reported employee figures vary across different sources, reflecting the dynamic nature of workforce data. Figures include 181 U.S.-based employees 6, 152 employees (based on 2019 data) 3, 286 employees (with a reported 4% growth in the last year, though the specific date of this count is not provided) 23, and 174 total employees.24 The 2024 ESG Report, citing the Great Place to Work survey, notes that "127 of us took the survey" but does not state the total employee count.4 Despite these discrepancies, the 2024 budget presentation indicates a proposed increase of 22 personnel, with 15 of these positions specifically allocated to capital-work focused activities, resulting in a net operating budget impact equivalent to 7 new employees.22 This planned growth suggests an active phase of workforce expansion, particularly in areas supporting capital projects and strategic initiatives. A conservative estimate, considering the various sources and recent hiring plans, would place the current employee count in the range of 170-200.
Market Capitalization: VELCO is not a publicly traded company; therefore, market capitalization is not applicable. Its ownership structure is private, held by its constituent distribution utilities and VLITE.3
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory: The company's financial trajectory is characterized by consistent revenue growth for VT Transco LLC, coupled with a strategic approach to managing costs. While total operating costs are projected to rise by 5.47% in 2024, driven by increases in property insurance, software program maintenance support, and the planned headcount expansion, the net cost of transmission services delivered to customers is simultaneously projected to decrease by $3.84 million in 2024 compared to the 2023 budget.22 This demonstrates effective financial stewardship and a clear focus on delivering value to its owners and their customers. The reported 4% growth in employee count over the past year further underscores this period of expansion and investment.23
Complete Geographic Footprint with Specific Locations and Size of Operations
VELCO's operational scope is primarily statewide across Vermont. In addition to its extensive presence within Vermont, the company also manages and operates limited transmission facilities in specific locations in New Hampshire, including Monroe, Littleton, and Hinsdale.18 Its operational activities are seamlessly integrated into the broader New England regional electric network, underscoring its role as a critical component of the regional grid infrastructure.1
The scale of VELCO's operations is substantial within its service area. The company is responsible for managing 740 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, which traverse diverse landscapes across the state.6 This network is supported by 55 substations, switching stations, and terminal facilities that are essential for power transmission and distribution.3 To maintain the integrity and safety of its transmission lines, VELCO also manages approximately 13,000 acres of rights-of-way.6 Beyond physical infrastructure, the company operates a sophisticated 1,500-mile fiber optic network, which is vital for monitoring and controlling the electric system and also provides broadband services.6 A statewide emergency radio system further enhances its operational resilience and communication capabilities during critical events.6 While its direct geographic reach is concentrated in Vermont and parts of New Hampshire, its operational efficiency and reliability have significant implications for the wider New England region due to its interconnected nature.
Ownership Structure
VELCO operates as a privately-held corporation, distinguishing it from publicly traded utilities. Its ownership is uniquely structured, held by Vermont's 17 local electric distribution utilities and the Vermont Low-Income Trust for Electricity (VLITE), a public benefit corporation.3 This model ensures that the company's operations are aligned with a public service mandate, with value being returned to its owners and, ultimately, their customers.
The governance of VELCO is overseen by a 13-member Board of Directors.3 This board is composed of representatives from its major utility owners, including Green Mountain Power (GMP), Burlington Electric Department (BED), Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC), and Vermont Public Power Supply Authority (VPPSA), alongside representatives from Public Power entities, VLITE, and the VELCO CEO.3 This diverse representation on the board is designed to ensure that the collective interests of Vermont's energy landscape are considered in strategic decision-making.
A significant historical change in ownership occurred around 2011-2012. This involved a transaction where Gaz Metro LP indirectly acquired Central Vermont Public Service (CVPS), which subsequently merged with Green Mountain Power. This event led to a change in ownership of over 10% of both VELCO's equity and Vermont Transco LLC.18 Crucially, as part of this agreement, CVPS and Green Mountain conveyed approximately 33% of their common equity interest in VELCO to VLITE, the public benefit corporation. This strategic maneuver ensured that the newly merged company would not achieve majority ownership of VELCO, thereby solidifying VELCO's commitment to its unique, publicly-beneficial ownership model and reinforcing its accountability to a broad spectrum of stakeholders.18 This historical context underscores the highly regulated environment in which VELCO operates and its dedication to maintaining a public-service oriented structure.
The proposed 22-person headcount increase, with 15 positions specifically designated for capital-work focused activities, signals a significant commitment to ongoing infrastructure development and modernization efforts.22 This expansion of the workforce, particularly in areas related to physical infrastructure, directly correlates with the growth and evolution of VELCO's operational technology (OT) footprint. As new substations, transmission lines, and control systems are built or upgraded, the complexity and scope of the OT environment naturally expand. This expansion inherently introduces new potential vulnerabilities and broadens the overall attack surface that requires protection. Therefore, this growth indicates a proactive stance on grid modernization and expansion, driven by the imperative to integrate clean energy sources and enhance overall grid reliability, while simultaneously increasing the criticality of robust OT security measures.

Contact information is publicly available at procurement@velco.com.19 Roles such as Manager Project Controls 23 and IT Business Analyst 5 also fall into this category, overseeing project-level execution and technology needs.
Decision-Making Patterns
Decision-making at VELCO appears to be a blend of top-down strategic direction from executive leadership and collaborative input from various departments, reflecting its "Belonging" culture and emphasis on cross-functional teamwork.4 The Board of Directors, with its diverse representation from owner utilities and public benefit entities, plays a significant oversight role in strategic decisions.3
Known approval processes for technology purchases are structured and emphasize fairness and due diligence. VELCO's procurement program is designed to support business operations and emergency situations by working collaboratively with vendors to obtain quality products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner.30 The program employs prequalification and defined sourcing processes to ensure fair, equitable, and ethical treatment of vendors.30 Prospective vendors are required to submit detailed company information—including name, website, contact details, Federal tax I.D., product/service information, year established, annual sales, employee count, and references—for consideration and inclusion on a bidders' list, followed by a formal qualification process.30 Prior to contract signature or work execution, proof of adequate insurance and an IRS W9 form are mandatory.30 While VELCO is a private corporation, its close ties to state utilities and regulatory bodies suggest it may adhere to rigorous, documented processes similar to those outlined in Vermont's state IT procurement guidelines, which involve high-level planning, identifying key project roles, determining funding, and assessing solutions.31
Budget authorities and financial approval thresholds are managed by the Chief Financial Officer, Michele C. Nelson, who is responsible for all fiscal management aspects of VELCO's operations.10 Budget presentations, such as the 2024 Proposed Operating and Capital Budget, are detailed and subject to review, likely by the Board of Directors and relevant committees.22 The 2024 budget highlights a strong focus on cost management, even amidst increased investments in headcount and software.22 This indicates a need for clear justification of expenditures, demonstrating tangible ROI or cost avoidance benefits.

Executive Sponsor (Strategic Alignment): Thomas Dunn, President & CEO. High-level engagement with Mr. Dunn should align NCC Group's value proposition with VELCO's overarching mission of reliability, sustainability, and its identity as a "trusted partner".1
Procurement: The Procurement department (procurement@velco.com) is the formal gateway for vendor engagement.30 Initiating contact here is essential for understanding formal vendor processes and requirements.
Middle Management: Engaging with roles such as the CIP Cybersecurity Engineer 28, IT Business Analyst 5, Radio Frequency Network Engineer 49, and Transmission Planning Manager 49 will provide valuable insights into day-to-day pain points, specific technical requirements, and potential project-level needs.
Organizational Entry Points
Several avenues can facilitate initial engagement with VELCO:
Direct Outreach to Dan Nelson: Given his explicit mandate over technology and security for critical systems, a direct, well-researched outreach highlighting NCC Group's expertise in OT/IT convergence and NERC CIP compliance would be highly effective.
Referrals/Networking: Leveraging existing relationships within the New England utility sector or through industry associations, such as the Vermont Chamber of Commerce or Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility (VBSR), where VELCO leaders are active, could provide warm introductions.26
Targeted Content Marketing: Developing and sharing case studies or whitepapers relevant to grid modernization, NERC CIP compliance, or OT security that directly address VELCO's publicly stated strategic initiatives and challenges (e.g., integrating distributed generation, securing new BESS deployments) can establish credibility and prompt interest.1
Formal Procurement Channel: Initiating contact through the formal procurement process for general vendor qualification can ensure NCC Group is on their approved bidders' list for future opportunities.30
Relationship-Building Strategy
A successful relationship with VELCO must be built on a foundation of partnership and shared values:
Partnership Approach: Emphasize NCC Group's role as a "trusted partner" rather than solely a vendor, directly aligning with VELCO's stated mission.1 This approach should convey a commitment to long-term collaboration.
Value-Driven Conversations: Focus discussions on how NCC Group's solutions can directly help VELCO achieve its strategic objectives: enhancing grid reliability, supporting clean energy integration, ensuring NERC CIP compliance, and improving overall operational efficiency and safety.
Demonstrate Understanding: Exhibit a deep understanding of the utility sector, VELCO's unique cooperative-like ownership structure, its profound commitment to sustainability, and its "Belonging" culture. This demonstrates thorough preparation and respect for their distinct operating model.
Long-Term Engagement: Position NCC Group as a strategic, enduring partner for VELCO's ongoing grid modernization and digital transformation journey, emphasizing continuous support and evolving solutions.
Communication Approach Aligned with Organizational Culture
Communication with VELCO should reflect their values and operational style:
Transparent and Collaborative: Mirror VELCO's core value of "Sharing information".3 Be open and clear about NCC Group's capabilities, proposed solutions, and any limitations. Foster a dialogue that encourages mutual understanding.
Data-Driven and Analytical: Align with VELCO's internal focus on rigorous planning, detailed assessments (e.g., 2024 VT Long-Range Transmission Plan, ERM program), and data-driven insights (e.g., POI Heat Map).1 Present information with supporting data and clear analytical reasoning.
Emphasize Safety & Reliability: These are fundamental to VELCO's identity and values.1 Frame cybersecurity solutions in terms of how they directly contribute to a safer, more reliable grid, protecting both physical assets and human lives.
Highlight ESG Alignment: Explicitly connect NCC Group's offerings to VELCO's extensive environmental and social commitments. For example, demonstrate how securing critical infrastructure for renewable energy projects or protecting smart grid technologies directly supports Vermont's decarbonization goals and contributes to a resilient grid for a sustainable future.
Respectful and Professional: Reflect the company's "Great Place to Work" culture and its emphasis on "Belonging".4 Maintain a professional, respectful tone in all interactions.
Timing Considerations Based on Organizational Cycle
Strategic timing can significantly impact engagement success:
Budget Cycle: VELCO's budget presentation for the upcoming fiscal year typically occurs in Q4 (e.g., the 2024 budget was presented in November 2023).22 This suggests that Q3 and Q4 are critical periods for initiating discussions that could influence the following year's budget allocations.
Long-Range Planning: The 2024 VT Long-Range Transmission Plan is a multi-year assessment.1 Engaging early in their planning cycles, for instance, when they are developing the next long-range plan, could position NCC Group as a strategic partner for future projects.
Project-Specific Timing: Monitor VELCO's news releases and job postings for announcements of specific projects (e.g., new substation upgrades, digital transformation initiatives) that might have immediate security consulting or service requirements. The March 2025 launch of the POI Heat Map indicates ongoing work in distributed generation integration that will have significant security implications.
Regulatory Deadlines: NERC CIP compliance is an ongoing and critical priority for VELCO.16 Understanding their internal audit cycles or upcoming compliance deadlines could create timely engagement opportunities for compliance assessments, gap analyses, or specific security control implementations.
The explicit mention of "software program maintenance support" as a driver of increased operating costs, including specific allocations for "security software" ($100,000) and "back office software" ($200,000) in the 2024 budget, provides a direct and quantifiable entry point for sales discussions around existing security spend and potential optimization.22 This indicates that VELCO is already investing in security tools but may be facing rising maintenance costs or seeking more comprehensive, integrated solutions to reduce overall complexity and cost. NCC Group can frame its value proposition around optimizing their current security expenditures, consolidating tools, or demonstrating how its managed services or platform approach could offer superior value or more comprehensive protection than their current arrangements. This shifts the conversation from justifying the need for security to demonstrating how NCC Group can enhance their security posture more effectively and efficiently.
Furthermore, VELCO's active engagement in workforce development initiatives, such as the AGILE internship program, and their focus on addressing the loss of experienced personnel due to retirements, suggests potential pain points around security skills gaps, particularly in the specialized OT domain.29 The need for "more coordination between teams" also points to challenges in integrating security across different operational silos. This creates a clear opportunity for NCC Group to offer services that augment VELCO's internal capabilities, such as managed detection and response (MDR), specialized security consulting, or targeted training programs. These offerings can help fill critical skills and capacity gaps, particularly in complex areas like OT security monitoring, incident response, or NERC CIP compliance, where specialized talent is scarce. This approach aligns directly with VELCO's stated goals of "improving grid reliability" and "delivering innovative services" by ensuring they possess the necessary security expertise to achieve these objectives.

Contents - History. - Administration. - Programs. - References. Vermont Electric Cooperative was founded in 1938 in Eden Mills to serve residents in parts of rural Lamoille County who had been bypassed by investor-owned utilities. The Rural Electrification Act financed most of the growth in the early years. Early service was extended into Chittenden and Franklin counties. From the 1940s until the early 1960s, the territory it served expanded in northern Vermont through the construction of new lines and the acquisition of small private companies. In 1969, Vermont Electric Cooperative expanded into southern Vermont by merging with Halifax Electric Cooperative. In 1970, Vermont Electric Cooperative acquired the International Electric Company serving Derby Line. In 2004, Vermont Electric Cooperative acquired Citizens Communications Company's Vermont Electric Division. This more than doubled the membership-base. In 2006, Vermont Electric Cooperative sold its Southern District in Windham and Windsor counties to Central Vermont Public Service (CVPS), reducing its membership by 2,770. Additionally 12 member services in 3 towns of MA were sold to Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) In 2009, Vermont Electric Cooperative announced that it would purchase 50% of the 40 megawatts Sheffield wind-generated electricity when it becomes available. The cooperative installed smart meters at 80% of their households from 2007 to 2009. Savings using these have paid for the equipment upgrades. A 12-member Board of Directors is elected by members. Seven seats are reserved for geographic districts. Five members are elected by the entire membership. District 1 includes the towns of Averill, Avery's Gore, Barton, Bloomfield, Brighton, Brownington, Brunswick, Canaan, Charleston, Ferdinand, Guildhall, Holland, Lemington, Lewis, Lyndon, Maidstone, Morgan, Newark, Norton, Sheffield, Sutton, Warner's Grant, Warren Gore, Westmore and Wheelock. There are also towns in Caledonia County. District 2 includes Coventry, Derby, and Newport city. The remaining towns in Orleans County are in District 5. District 4 includes Jay, Lowell, Newport town, Westfield, and Troy. District 8 includes Albany, Barton, Craftsbury, Glover, Greensboro, and towns in Lamoille and Caledonia counties. The president of the Board of Directors is Dan Carswell. In 2013, there were 18 candidates for three open seats on the board. Vermont Electric Cooperative not only supplies electricity to members, but also offers a range of programs including bill credits for the purchase of certain electric appliances and devices including electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, heat pumps, heat pump hot water heaters, pellet stoves, electric forklifts In December 2016, Vermont Electric Cooperative launched Co-op Community Solar, a program under which members can sponsor solar panels in community solar arrays. Members pay an upfront payment for a term of either ten or twenty years and get a fixed monthly credit on their electric bill.
