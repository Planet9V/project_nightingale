Go-To-Market Analysis: San Francisco International Airport
GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
Executive Summary
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) stands as a critical U.S. and international aviation hub, distinguished by its governance structure as an enterprise department of the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF).1 This unique status imbues SFO with a dual character: a public entity accountable to municipal oversight, yet an economically self-reliant operation. The airport generates substantial revenue, supports a large workforce, and manages an extensive and complex physical infrastructure.3
The leadership team, recently welcoming a new Airport Director, Mike Nakornkhet, in early 2025 7, combines public sector experience with deep aviation industry knowledge. This blend influences strategic direction and operational management. SFO is navigating a period of significant activity, marked by recovery from pandemic-induced disruptions, progression on major Capital Improvement Program (CIP) projects, the rollout of a comprehensive 2023-2028 Strategic Plan, and substantial technology modernization efforts.8
Competitively, SFO maintains a robust market share within the San Francisco Bay Area and serves as a key hub for United Airlines.13 It faces competition from other major West Coast airports, particularly for international and transpacific routes. Understanding SFO's multifaceted organizational context, leadership dynamics, recent developments, and competitive standing is paramount for developing effective engagement strategies.
Organizational Profile
1. Organization Overview
Full legal name and corporate structure:
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) operates as an enterprise department of the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF).1 Its governance falls under the Airport Commission of the City and County of San Francisco, which is responsible for setting policy and overseeing the airport's operations.2 This structure signifies that while SFO functions with a degree of financial independence, generating its own revenue to cover operational costs and capital investments 4, it remains subject to the broader governance, policies, and procurement regulations inherent to a public municipal entity. This duality is a critical factor in understanding SFO's decision-making processes, funding mechanisms for large projects, and overall strategic direction. Procurement activities, for example, are likely to follow stringent public sector protocols, emphasizing transparency and open competition, potentially leading to longer sales cycles and requiring engagement with both airport management and city officials.19
Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations:
SFO was founded in 1927, originally named Mills Field.25 The airport's administrative headquarters is listed with a mailing address of P.O. Box 8097, San Francisco, CA 94128-8097.26 Physically, SFO is situated approximately 14 miles south of downtown San Francisco, predominantly within unincorporated San Mateo County, adjacent to the San Francisco Bay.3 This geographical placement under CCSF ownership creates a distinct jurisdictional arrangement, which can influence areas such as emergency response coordination and law enforcement.27
SFO's operational footprint is extensive, encompassing four runways, four passenger terminals (Harvey Milk Terminal 1, Terminal 2, Terminal 3, and the Dianne Feinstein International Terminal), 91 operational gates, a rental car center, five parking garages, the AirTrain automated people mover system, dedicated cargo and aircraft maintenance facilities (including a significant United Airlines Maintenance Operation Center), and its own wastewater treatment plant.3 The sheer scale and diversity of these operational locations underscore a large and complex physical and digital environment, presenting a correspondingly broad attack surface that requires comprehensive security considerations. The distributed nature of these assets implies a need for security strategies that can effectively cover both passenger-facing areas and critical back-of-house operational and industrial systems.
Organizational history and key milestones:
SFO's history is one of continuous growth and adaptation since its inception as Mills Field in 1927.25 Key milestones include the construction of the Central Terminal (later Terminal 2) in 1954, the South Terminal (Terminal 1) in 1963, and the North Terminal (Terminal 3) in 1979, followed by the landmark International Terminal Building (ITB) in 2000.25 SFO was a pioneer in passenger convenience, installing the first jet bridges in the United States in 1959.25 The airport has consistently responded to shifts in the aviation industry, including deregulation and the impacts of global events like 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic.25
More recently, significant developments include the renaming of the International Terminal to honor the late Senator Dianne Feinstein in January 2024 31, the multi-phase completion of the award-winning Harvey Milk Terminal 1 (final phase opened June 2024) 33, and the commencement of the major Terminal 3 West Modernization project in August 2024, a $2.6 billion endeavor expected to conclude between 2027 and 2029.34 This consistent pattern of large-scale capital projects and modernization efforts suggests an organizational culture that is receptive to innovation and improvement, including advanced security solutions, particularly when aligned with strategic objectives like enhancing passenger experience and operational efficiency. These ongoing major capital projects present continuous opportunities to integrate security solutions from the design and construction phases, which is often more effective and economical than retrofitting.
Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):
SFO's primary business activity is airport operations. This is classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 48811 (Airport Operations), which further breaks down into 488111 (Air Traffic Control) and 488119 (Other Airport Operations).41 Core activities encompass facilitating passenger and cargo transit, managing extensive terminal concessions (retail and dining), operating parking facilities, and leasing property to airlines and other airport-related businesses.3 The breadth of these activities means SFO utilizes a wide array of specialized IT and Operational Technology (OT) systems, each with unique cybersecurity requirements.
Precise company size metrics:
SFO is a significant economic entity. Its financial performance has shown strong recovery and growth in recent years:
Annual Operating Revenues:
Fiscal Year 2022: $821.25 million 4
Fiscal Year 2023: $1,064.10 million 4
Fiscal Year 2024: $1,401.39 million 6 This upward trend in revenue, coupled with increasing passenger volumes (47.1 million in FY23, a 34.9% year-over-year increase, and 51.3 million in FY24, a 9.0% year-over-year increase 4), indicates a robust financial position and operational expansion. This financial capacity is crucial for funding SFO's ambitious Capital Improvement Plan and other strategic investments, including technology and cybersecurity upgrades. The rebound creates inherent pressure to ensure that all supporting infrastructure, including IT and security systems, can scale reliably and perform under increasing load, a potential area where advanced cybersecurity solutions can provide significant value.
Employee Count: SFO directly employs approximately 1,700 City and County of San Francisco personnel.5 However, the proposed FY 2025-26 budget includes funding for 2,106.63 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs), suggesting planned growth in staffing to support expanding operations and new initiatives.22 This increase may include roles within IT and cybersecurity.
Market Capitalization: As a department of the CCSF, SFO is not a publicly traded company and therefore does not have a market capitalization.
Financial Trajectory: The airport's financial trajectory is positive, with significant increases in both passenger traffic and operating revenues from FY2022 through FY2024.4 The FY2025-26 budget anticipates continued growth, supported by these strong recovery indicators.22
Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations:
SFO's main campus spans approximately 5,200 acres in San Mateo County.42 Key operational facilities, as previously noted, include four passenger terminals, multiple boarding areas, extensive parking structures, the AirTrain system with nine stations, a United Airlines Maintenance Operation Center, numerous cargo buildings, a U.S. Postal Service facility, and an on-site wastewater treatment plant.3 The presence of critical third-party facilities, such as the United Airlines Maintenance Operation Center, on airport grounds introduces interconnected risk vectors that SFO's overall security posture must address, as vulnerabilities in tenant systems could potentially impact broader airport operations.
Detailed corporate structure including parent-subsidiary relationships, business units and divisions, recent restructuring initiatives, merger and acquisition history:
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: SFO is a department of its parent entity, the City and County of San Francisco.1 It does not have subsidiaries in the traditional corporate sense.
Business Units and Divisions: SFO is organized into a comprehensive array of divisions to manage its diverse operations. These include, but are not limited to, Accounting, Administration, Airfield Operations, Aviation Security, Design & Construction, Facilities Operations & Maintenance, Information Technology & Telecommunications (ITT), Marketing & Communications, Planning & Environmental Affairs, and Revenue Development & Management.26 Additionally, both the San Francisco Fire Department and San Francisco Police Department maintain dedicated airport divisions to provide emergency and security services.26 The extensive number of specialized divisions may lead to operational silos, a challenge that the airport's new Technology Improvement Program (TIP) aims to address by fostering greater integration and reducing such siloes.8
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: The most significant ongoing organizational evolution stems from the implementation of the "Inspiring the Extraordinary 2023-2028 Strategic Plan" 8 and the associated Technology Improvement Program (TIP), launched in January 2025.9 TIP, in particular, represents a major initiative to centralize and modernize IT/OT infrastructure, viewing technology as a utility. This strategic shift towards integrated and standardized systems presents substantial opportunities for cybersecurity solutions designed for complex, converged environments. The appointment of Mike Nakornkhet as the new Airport Director in early 2025 7 may also catalyze further organizational refinements and strategic adjustments.
Merger and Acquisition History: As a public entity, SFO's growth has been organic, focused on facility expansion and development rather than corporate mergers or acquisitions.25
Ownership structure:
SFO is wholly owned and operated by the City and County of San Francisco.3 It is not publicly traded. This public ownership model underscores the importance of transparency in operations and procurement, and accountability to public stakeholders, the Airport Commission, and elected CCSF officials. Major strategic decisions and significant capital expenditures, such as those required for comprehensive cybersecurity system overhauls, typically necessitate approval from the Airport Commission and, for bond-funded initiatives, potentially the CCSF Board of Supervisors.19

He has a 35-year career in public and private real estate development, is a decorated Vietnam veteran, and a graduate of the University of San Francisco.50
Information Gap: Specific standing committees of the Airport Commission and their current member assignments were not explicitly found. Review of recent Airport Commission meeting agendas and minutes (e.g., from May/June 2025 110) is required to identify these. The provided links to the May 20 and June 3, 2025 agendas 110 should be consulted. Initial checks of these derived URLs were unsuccessful; direct PDF links were not in the source snippets, only references to their availability. The calendar/agenda items 111 do not list committees.
IT and Security leadership:
SFO's technology and security leadership is multi-layered, involving dedicated airport personnel and oversight from the City and County of San Francisco.
Chief Digital Transformation Officer (CDTO): Iyad Hindiyeh is the highest-ranking technology executive on SFO's public leadership roster.1 He spearheads the Technology Improvement Program (TIP) and has a background as CEO of Pangiam Technologies and in strategic roles at Amadeus and IATA.57
Reporting to the CDTO is the Information Technology and Telecommunications (ITT) Operations Director (a Manager VI classification), who oversees ITT operations including Infrastructure Design & Engineering, Provisioning, and the Technology Support & Network Operations Center (NOC).114 An ITT Manager (reporting to the ITT Director) further manages technology services and technical staff.115
Cybersecurity - IT Governance Director: Guy Clarke has held this role since October 2017.116 His direct reports include a Manager for the Security Access Office, a Manager of Information & Data Services, and a Project Director for Cybersecurity.116 Mr. Clarke is CISA certified and an ISO 27001 Lead Auditor.116
Director & CISO: Jonathan Kaplan is listed in Evanta community profiles as holding this role at SFO, sometimes noted as "CISO (Acting)".117 However, he is not listed on SFO's official leadership page 1, and his current status and reporting structure require clarification. This is an information gap.
Director of Security and Emergency Management: Rob Forester leads physical security and emergency preparedness for the airport.119
An Aviation Security Operations Supervisor (Job Class 9220) manages Aviation Security Analysts and ensures compliance with Transportation Security Regulations (TSR) and the Airport Security Program.120
It is also crucial to note that the City and County of San Francisco employs a city-wide Chief Information Security Officer (CCISO) who is responsible for the cybersecurity needs and risk management of all 54 city departments, including SFO. The City has a comprehensive Cyber Policy that SFO would be subject to.2 This dual structure implies that cybersecurity solutions for SFO must likely satisfy both airport-specific operational requirements and broader CCSF cybersecurity mandates and standards.
Middle management in relevant departments:
IT Infrastructure and Operations: The ITT Operations Director and ITT Manager roles, detailed above, represent key middle management in IT.114
Security Operations: The Aviation Security Operations Supervisor and the Manager - Security Access Office (reporting to Guy Clarke) are key middle management contacts in security.116
Procurement and Vendor Management: Erron Alvey is the Director of Procurement and Contracts Section within Design & Construction.44 Victor Madrigal, Procurement and Contract Manager, was the contact for the recent CIP Support Services RFP.122 SFO's general purchasing department can be reached at 650-821-2848.26 These contacts are pivotal for navigating SFO's procurement processes, which were a topic of demystification at the SFO Tech Day.8
Decision-making patterns:
Technology and security investment decisions at SFO are likely influenced by several layers of authority. The Airport Commission serves as the primary policy-making body, with approval power over major contracts, strategic plans, and bond issuances for capital projects.20 The Airport Director (Mike Nakornkhet) is responsible for day-to-day management and execution of the Commission's policies.20
For technology and cybersecurity initiatives, the CDTO (Iyad Hindiyeh) would be a primary decision-maker and influencer, working with his IT and cybersecurity directors (like Guy Clarke and potentially Jonathan Kaplan). Their recommendations would be shaped by the "Inspiring the Extraordinary 2023-2028 Strategic Plan" 8 and the Technology Improvement Program (TIP).8 These documents outline clear priorities for modernization, efficiency, guest experience, and security enhancement, providing a framework against which potential investments are evaluated.
Significant expenditures, especially those requiring bond funding or impacting airport-wide policy, would proceed from departmental recommendations to the Airport Director, and then to the Airport Commission for final approval. The budget approval process itself is integrated with the City and County of San Francisco's overall budget cycle.22 The SFO Tech Day initiative also suggests an organizational interest in streamlining vendor engagement and clearly communicating technology needs.8

3. Recent News and Developments and Strategic Direction (Past 18 Months: Approx. Dec 2023 - June 2025)
The period from December 2023 to June 2025 has been exceptionally active for San Francisco International Airport, characterized by significant infrastructure projects, strategic advancements, and continued recovery and growth in passenger traffic.
Comprehensive News Analysis:
A review of official press releases and reputable news sources reveals several key themes:
Infrastructure Modernization and Expansion: This has been a dominant focus. Major projects include the five-month closure of Runway 28L for a critical taxiway improvement project, which began in January 2024 and concluded by June/July 2024, aimed at enhancing aircraft safety and operational efficiency.33 The ambitious $2.6 billion Terminal 3 West Modernization project commenced in August 2024, with phased completions expected through 2027-2029; this project involves seismic retrofitting, expanded security checkpoints, and enhanced passenger amenities.34 June 2024 saw the opening of the final phase of the $2.5 billion Harvey Milk Terminal 1, a facility lauded for its design, sustainability, and passenger experience features.33 In May 2024, SFO also initiated a phased upgrade of the roof and façade of the Senator Dianne Feinstein International Terminal, including solar panel installation, slated for completion in early 2026.33 The sheer volume of these concurrent, large-scale construction and renovation activities creates a highly dynamic and complex IT and OT environment. Such periods of intense physical change inherently increase the risk of temporary security vulnerabilities, system integration challenges, and misconfigurations, making robust cybersecurity program management, continuous monitoring, and oversight particularly critical.
Strategic Branding and Passenger Growth: SFO unveiled a new logo and brand identity in August 2024, signaling its ongoing commitment to modernization and an "extraordinary passenger experience".127 The airport has consistently reported positive passenger traffic forecasts, with an expected 4% increase for the summer 2025 travel season, projecting 16.2 million travelers and reaching 93% of pre-pandemic summer levels.129 United Airlines, SFO's largest carrier, announced a significant 20% increase in flights out of SFO for 2025, further underscoring this growth trajectory and SFO's role as a global gateway.133
Technological Innovation and Recognition: SFO received a 2025 CIO 100 award for the in-house development of "SFOCite," a mobile app for ground transportation enforcement launched in February 2024, which digitized citation issuance and management, improving efficiency.138 The airport's free Remote Bag Check service, launched in November 2024, processed over 15,000 bags by March 2025, highlighting successful passenger-facing technology adoption.138 These examples of successful in-house development and deployment of new technologies suggest an internal IT capability that is proactive and focused on operational improvement and passenger convenience. This internal strength could make SFO an informed partner for advanced security solutions, potentially with specific integration needs or a preference for solutions that augment their existing capabilities.
Sustainability Leadership: SFO continues to be recognized for its environmental initiatives, receiving a statewide Policy Leadership Award from the U.S. Green Building Council California in May 2025 for its green building policies.140 In September 2024, Airports Council International – North America (ACI-NA) honored SFO with an Environmental Achievement Award for its "All-Electric Concessions Initiative".143
New Air Services: Several airlines announced new or expanded services at SFO, including Porter Airlines to Toronto (Jan 2024) 144, United Airlines to Panama City (service starting May 2025, announced Dec 2024) 145, TAP Air Portugal to the Azores (June 2025) 146, Air India with a new Kolkata stopover (June 2025) 147, and Frontier Airlines to Palm Springs and Vail (Dec 2024).148
Financial Health: S&P Global Ratings upgraded SFO's long-term and underlying rating on its senior airport system revenue bonds to 'AA-' with a stable outlook in January 2025, a first-time 'AA' category rating from S&P for SFO.10 Fitch Ratings also affirmed its 'A+' rating with a stable outlook in January 2025.17 These positive assessments were attributed to traffic recovery, strong financial performance, and beneficial modifications to airline agreements.
Strategic Initiatives and Direction:
SFO's strategic direction is clearly articulated in its "Inspiring the Extraordinary 2023-2028 Strategic Plan".8 Approved in November 2023, this plan outlines six core goals: Empowering a Culture of Safety and Security Excellence; Providing an Outstanding Guest Experience; Elevating SFO Pride with an Exceptional Employee Experience; Taking Bold Climate Action; Igniting Business Innovation; and Achieving Social Impact through Partnerships. Each goal is underpinned by specific objectives and initiatives, many of which have direct implications for technology and security. For instance, Goal 1 explicitly includes enhancing SFO’s security posture through strategic investment in assets, infrastructure, and technology, strengthening the Cyber Security Office, and improving video monitoring capabilities.12
A cornerstone of SFO's technology strategy is the Technology Improvement Program (TIP), officially launched in January 2025.8 This three- to five-year roadmap aims to transform SFO's technology infrastructure into a utility, ensuring a proactive, resilient, and agile foundation. Key TIP focus areas include infrastructure enablement (e.g., network upgrades, cloud architecture), augmented guest experiences, technology upskilling for staff, and crucially, cybersecurity enhancements. The TIP's objective to reduce siloes and enable real-time data visibility across the organization points towards significant IT/OT convergence efforts.
The overarching $11 billion Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) continues to drive much of SFO's activity, funding terminal modernizations, airfield improvements, and utility upgrades.2 The explicit linkage between these strategic plans and cybersecurity creates clear alignment for proposing relevant solutions.
Organizational Changes:
The most prominent organizational change during this period is the appointment of Mike Nakornkhet as the new Airport Director in early 2025, succeeding Ivar Satero.1 Such leadership transitions often create opportune moments for new vendors to introduce innovative solutions, as new executives frequently review existing strategies and partnerships. Mr. Nakornkhet's prior financial roles at SFO and his experience managing large capital projects at Denver International Airport suggest he will likely prioritize efficient, effective, and strategically aligned investments, including in critical areas like security and technology.7 While SFO's official leadership page has seen some updates to titles for existing personnel 1, no other major executive departures or large-scale departmental restructurings were prominently announced in the provided materials for this period.
Financial Developments:
SFO's financial activities have been robust, primarily driven by the need to fund its extensive CIP. In January/February 2025, the Airport Commission successfully issued approximately $996 million to $1 billion in Series 2025A/B/C revenue bonds. The proceeds are designated for financing portions of the CIP and repaying commercial paper notes previously used for capital projects.2 This successful bond issuance, coupled with the positive rating actions from S&P Global (upgrade to 'AA-') and Fitch Ratings (affirmation of 'A+') in January 2025 10, underscores SFO's financial health and its capacity to undertake and fund large-scale infrastructure developments. The proposed FY2025-26 operating budget also reflects increases to support continued passenger growth and the CIP.22 Furthermore, SFO has awarded significant contracts for CIP-related work, such as the Project Management Support Services contract to AtkinsRéalis for the Airfield Improvement Program 2024-2029 (March 2025) 150 and a $26 million contract to Granite for taxiway rehabilitation (May 2025).154 These financial activities demonstrate active investment in the airport's future, with cybersecurity being an intrinsic component of modern infrastructure resilience.

4. Competitive Context
Detailed competitor analysis:
San Francisco International Airport (SFO) operates in a competitive environment, primarily contending with other major airports on the U.S. West Coast. Its main direct competitors for regional and domestic traffic are Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport (SJC) and Oakland International Airport (OAK).4 For broader domestic, and particularly international and transpacific routes, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) represent significant competitors.13
SFO commands a strong market share within the immediate San Francisco Bay Area, consistently capturing over 60% of passenger traffic.15 This dominance is bolstered by its status as a major hub for United Airlines, which accounts for approximately 46-50% of SFO's passenger market share, and its role as United's primary transpacific gateway.13 Alaska Airlines also operates a significant hub at SFO.39
While LAX is a larger airport overall in terms of passenger volume 39, SFO has demonstrated robust recovery and growth post-pandemic. In March 2025, while OAK and SJC reported year-over-year passenger traffic declines, SFO's traffic continued its upward trend.4 The strong airline partnerships, particularly with United, are a double-edged sword: they guarantee a significant traffic base but also create a concentration risk should the airline significantly alter its hub strategy. However, United's recent announcement of a 20% increase in SFO flying for 2025 and its deep involvement in the Terminal 3 modernization project signal a continued strong commitment.40 The competitive pressure, especially from LAX, necessitates continuous innovation in passenger experience, operational efficiency, and security to maintain SFO's attractiveness to both airlines and travelers.
Industry standing:
SFO is consistently recognized as a leading airport globally and within North America. It was ranked the 13th busiest airport in the United States and the 29th busiest in the world by passenger traffic in 2023.39 The airport has garnered numerous accolades for its passenger experience, terminal design (particularly Harvey Milk Terminal 1), sustainability initiatives, technological innovation (including CIO 100 awards), and its diverse food and beverage offerings.138 Its strong credit ratings from agencies like S&P Global ('AA-') and Fitch Ratings ('A+') reflect financial stability and prudent management, further bolstering its industry standing.10 This consistent recognition suggests an organizational culture that values excellence and is willing to invest in maintaining its leadership position, which can be a favorable factor when proposing high-quality, advanced cybersecurity solutions.
Market challenges:
SFO, like the broader aviation industry, faces several market challenges. These include macroeconomic uncertainties such as fluctuating fuel prices and concerns about potential economic downturns that could impact domestic travel demand.182 Staff shortages and supply chain issues for aircraft and parts also present ongoing operational hurdles for airlines, which can indirectly affect airport operations.184
Specific to SFO, its high percentage of origin and destination (O&D) traffic, while indicating a strong local market, makes achieving dominant market share in the way a pure connecting hub might more challenging.13 The airport's location in a fog-prone area, combined with its parallel runway configuration, can lead to air traffic delays, particularly during inclement weather, affecting on-time performance.189 While SFO dominates the Bay Area market, it faces competition from regional airports OAK and SJC for certain market segments, and significant competition from LAX for international routes.13
A major ongoing challenge is the funding and execution of its massive $11 billion Capital Improvement Plan.2 While financially sound, managing a CIP of this magnitude amidst other market pressures requires careful planning and execution. The "uncertain macroeconomic environment" 182 could put pressure on budgets, making cybersecurity solutions that demonstrate clear ROI or cost savings particularly attractive. Furthermore, given SFO's geographic and operational characteristics, disruptions (including those from cyber incidents) can significantly impact its O&D passenger base and competitive standing for reliability.
Strategic differentiation:
SFO differentiates itself through a multi-faceted strategy that emphasizes an "extraordinary airport experience".1 This is supported by significant investments in modern, aesthetically pleasing, and passenger-friendly terminals like the Harvey Milk Terminal 1. A core differentiator is its profound commitment to sustainability, aiming for "Zero by 2030" (net zero energy, carbon, and waste) and achieving world-first certifications like airport-wide LEED Platinum.142
Innovation in technology is another key pillar, evidenced by CIO 100 awards for in-house app development and the strategic Technology Improvement Program.8 Its role as a primary Pacific gateway for United Airlines and a hub for Alaska Airlines provides a strong foundation for its route network.13 Unique cultural offerings, such as the accredited SFO Museum and the "SFO Celebrates" event series, further enhance its brand and passenger appeal.1 The recently refreshed brand identity 127 aims to encapsulate this commitment to being a world-class airport. Protecting these valuable differentiators and the airport's reputation from the impacts of a security breach is a critical imperative.

5. Corporate Culture and Values
Stated mission, vision, and values:
SFO's strategic direction is anchored by a clearly defined mission and vision, adopted as part of its 2023-2028 Strategic Plan. The mission, "Delivering an airport experience where people and our planet come first," and the vision, "Inspiring the Extraordinary," 8 guide its operational priorities and investments. These statements highlight a dual commitment: to the well-being of its diverse stakeholders (passengers, employees, tenants, and the broader community) and to robust environmental stewardship. Core values explicitly mentioned or championed include Safety & Security and Equity.12 This people-and-planet-centric philosophy provides a strong alignment for cybersecurity solutions that protect individuals from data breaches or operational disruptions caused by cyber threats, and that ensure the resilience of critical infrastructure, thereby safeguarding both people and the airport's environmental commitments.
Corporate social responsibility initiatives:
SFO demonstrates a significant commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Key initiatives include the "SFO Unites Against Hunger" food donation program, which redirects surplus edible food from airport concessions to Bay Area residents in need.142 The airport also runs extensive Zero Waste programs, such as eliminating single-use plastic beverage containers, promoting compostable foodware, and piloting innovative recycling efforts like nitrile glove recycling.142 Employee engagement in CSR is encouraged through volunteer programs supporting local schools and community organizations.160 The airport's Social Impact Section, with its Economic and Community Development and Workforce Standards and Development units, further operationalizes SFO's commitment to economic equity and community benefit.160 This strong CSR focus indicates an organization highly conscious of its public image and broader societal impact; a significant security incident could tarnish this carefully cultivated reputation.
Diversity and inclusion programs:
SFO has implemented comprehensive Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, managed by its Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.160 A cornerstone of this effort is the establishment of seven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): AAPI@SFO, BIPOC@SFO, LatinX@SFO, Out@SFO, Parents@SFO, Vets@SFO, and Women@SFO. These employee-led groups foster an inclusive workplace and provide support and advocacy for diverse employee communities.160
SFO also hosts events like the "Courageous Conversation Speaker Series" and "DEI’s Noontime Knowledge Workshops" to promote dialogue and learning on social issues and inclusivity.160 The airport is actively implementing its Racial Equity Action Plan (REAP) and has developed Career Lattice Guides and mentoring/buddy programs to support employee development and advancement.42 This robust DEI framework suggests a culture that values diverse perspectives and strives for an equitable and supportive employee experience. Engagement with SFO should reflect an understanding and respect for these values.
Environmental and sustainability commitments:
Sustainability is a central pillar of SFO's identity and strategic operations. The airport has set an ambitious "Zero by 2030" goal, aiming for net zero energy facilities, net zero carbon operations, and zero waste going to landfill.142 SFO was the first airport in the world to achieve airport-wide LEED Platinum certification for its environmental design and construction standards.142 It is also a leader in promoting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).142
Tangible initiatives include the prohibition of selling water in plastic bottles (expanded to all beverages), the transition to reusable or fiber-based disposable foodware in concessions, an Electrification Action Plan for buildings and vehicles, and numerous other programs aimed at reducing environmental impact.142 SFO has received multiple awards for its green leadership.142 These commitments rely heavily on technology-driven systems for energy management, waste tracking, and resource optimization. The security of these Operational Technology (OT) systems is therefore critical to achieving SFO's high-profile environmental targets and maintaining its reputation as a sustainability leader. A compromise of these systems could lead to operational failures, inaccurate environmental reporting, or even physical damage, undermining SFO's substantial investments in this area.
Corporate communications style:
SFO maintains a proactive and public-facing communication style. This is evident through its regular dissemination of press releases announcing achievements, new services, and project milestones.40 The airport is active on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook, using these channels to engage with the public and share updates.40 Initiatives like the "SFO Celebrates" experiential series, which brings local cultural events into the airport terminals, further demonstrate a commitment to positive passenger and community engagement.129 The development of the Strategic Plan also involved multilingual town halls, indicating an effort towards inclusive communication.12 This generally open and positive communication strategy means that any significant security incident would likely face considerable public and media scrutiny, underscoring the importance of robust incident response capabilities to manage potential reputational damage.
Employee review themes from platforms like Glassdoor:
Direct aggregated employee review themes from platforms like Glassdoor were not available in the provided information. This represents an information gap. However, SFO has received external recognition that suggests a positive work environment. For instance, it was named a "Healthiest Workplace" for large companies in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times.198 More recently, in February 2025, SFO was among the first U.S. airports to earn Level 1 Airport Workforce Development Accreditation from Airports Council International – North America (ACI-NA), a program that assesses strategic workforce planning and employee engagement.169
Additionally, SFO's worker retention policy was highlighted during layoffs by a contractor (Gate Gourmet), with another contractor (LSG Sky Chefs) expected to rehire most affected employees.199 The airport also actively recruits for roles like "Learning & Development Partner," with job descriptions emphasizing the creation of an energizing, empowering, and inclusive culture.200 These factors collectively point towards an organizational focus on employee well-being, development, and retention. Security solutions that impact employees, such as new security protocols or training requirements, should therefore be presented with careful consideration for user experience and ease of adoption to align with this supportive cultural emphasis.
Leadership communication patterns from public sources:
SFO's leadership, including the current Airport Director Mike Nakornkhet and his predecessor Ivar Satero, as well as other C-suite executives like CDTO Iyad Hindiyeh and COO Jeff Littlefield, regularly communicate through official channels such as press releases and industry interviews.7 These communications typically highlight achievements, strategic priorities (innovation, sustainability, passenger experience, safety/security), and project milestones. This consistent messaging across multiple platforms and by various leaders reinforces these areas as deeply embedded organizational values and priorities. The accessibility of leadership for discussing key initiatives, such as the CDTO speaking about the Technology Improvement Program, is also apparent.
Recognition and awards for corporate culture:
SFO has received accolades that reflect positively on its corporate culture. The "Healthiest Workplace" award 198 and the ACI-NA Airport Workforce Development Accreditation 169 are notable examples. The ACI-NA accreditation, even at an initial Level 1, signifies a formal commitment to enhancing strategic workforce planning and employee engagement, which are integral components of a strong corporate culture. This external validation suggests that SFO is actively working to create a supportive and development-oriented environment for its employees.
Engagement Recommendations
Key stakeholders to approach:
Executive Leadership: Airport Director (Mike Nakornkhet), CDTO (Iyad Hindiyeh), and COO (Jeff Littlefield) are primary targets. Their strategic priorities (financial prudence, digital transformation, operational excellence, security) align with NCC Group's offerings.
IT & Security Leadership: Cybersecurity - IT Governance Director (Guy Clarke), Director & CISO (Jonathan Kaplan - status to be confirmed), ITT Operations Director. These individuals are directly responsible for the areas NCC Group addresses.
Airport Commission: While not a direct sales target, understanding their priorities and concerns is crucial, as they approve major investments. President Malcolm Yeung's community focus is noteworthy.
Procurement Leadership: Director of Procurement and Contracts Section (Erron Alvey) and relevant contract managers are key for navigating the purchasing process.
Organizational entry points:
Technology Improvement Program (TIP): This is a major, current initiative with explicit cybersecurity components. Engaging with the CDTO and his team regarding TIP is a prime entry point.
Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Projects: Major terminal renovations (T3 West) and infrastructure upgrades present opportunities to embed security solutions. Engaging with the CDO (Judi Mosqueda) and procurement for these projects is viable.
Response to Industry Trends/Threats: Leveraging broader aviation industry security concerns (e.g., OT threats, data breaches at other airports) to initiate discussions about SFO's preparedness.
SFO Tech Day Follow-up: If NCC Group participated or can leverage insights from SFO's Tech Day, this provides a natural conversation starter.
Relationship-building strategy:
Align with SFO's Mission & Values: Emphasize how NCC Group's solutions help SFO achieve its mission of "people and planet first" and its vision of "Inspiring the Extraordinary." Highlight contributions to safety, security, passenger experience, and operational resilience (which supports sustainability).
Acknowledge Public Entity Nature: Understand and respect CCSF governance and procurement processes. Demonstrate experience working with public sector or similarly regulated entities.
Focus on Partnership: Position NCC Group as a long-term strategic partner, not just a vendor, especially given SFO's interest in collaborative vendor relationships (evidenced by Tech Day).
Leverage Local Presence (if applicable): Highlighting any Bay Area presence or understanding of the local context can be beneficial.
Communication approach aligned with organizational culture:
Professional and Data-Driven: SFO leadership is experienced and manages a complex, multi-billion dollar enterprise. Communications should be well-researched, clear, and demonstrate a strong understanding of airport operations and challenges.
Highlight Innovation and Best Practices: SFO prides itself on innovation and industry leadership. Frame solutions in terms of cutting-edge technology and alignment with global best practices.
Emphasize Positive Outcomes: Focus on the benefits of proposed solutions – enhanced security, improved passenger trust, operational efficiency, support for sustainability goals – aligning with SFO's positive public communications style.
Respect DEI Values: Ensure all interactions and materials are inclusive and respectful of SFO's strong DEI commitments.
Timing considerations based on organizational cycle:
New Airport Director Transition (Early-Mid 2025): This period is often opportune for introducing new solutions as new leadership reviews strategies.
Budget Cycles: SFO's fiscal year and budget approval timelines (typically involving Airport Commission review and CCSF processes) are critical. The FY25-26 budget was under development/approval in early 2024 for the period starting July 1, 2024.22 Align proposals with these cycles.
TIP and CIP Project Timelines: Key milestones within the Technology Improvement Program and the Capital Improvement Plan will create specific windows of opportunity for related security solutions. For example, the development of the "new cloud enterprise architecture by December 2025" 12 is a key date.
Contract Renewal Cycles: Identifying renewal dates for existing security solutions (if possible through public records) can indicate opportunities. Information Gap: Specific contract renewal dates for current security vendors are not available in the provided snippets.
