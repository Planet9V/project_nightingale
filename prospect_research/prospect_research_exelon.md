Go-To-Market Analysis: Exelon Corporation
GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Exelon Corporation
Executive Summary
Exelon Corporation stands as a Fortune 200 company and one of the largest utility holding companies in the United States, primarily focused on regulated transmission and distribution operations through its six utility subsidiaries.1 Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Exelon serves over 10.7 million customers across Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.1 Incorporated in 1999, the company has a significant history rooted in the evolution of the U.S. energy sector, recently marked by the separation of its power generation and competitive energy business into Constellation Energy Corp. in 2022, allowing Exelon to concentrate on its regulated utility operations.
The leadership team, spearheaded by President and CEO Calvin G. Butler Jr. 2, is composed of experienced executives with backgrounds in utility operations, finance, legal, and strategy. The Board of Directors, recently chaired by W. Paul Bowers 5, includes individuals with extensive expertise in the utilities industry, finance, technology, and cybersecurity.
Recent significant developments include a robust capital investment plan of $38 billion over the next four years, aimed at modernizing infrastructure and meeting growing energy demands, particularly from data centers.2 The company reported strong financial performance in early 2025, with increased earnings driven by rate adjustments and operational efficiencies.2 Strategic initiatives emphasize sustainability, innovation (as evidenced by its Climate Change Investment Initiative - 2c2i), and workforce development.1
Competitively, Exelon is a major player in the U.S. regulated utility sector, with a market share of approximately 5.88% in the broader Utilities Sector and 6.04% in the Electric Utilities Industry as of Q4 2024.9 Its strategic differentiation lies in its operational excellence in densely populated urban areas, a strong commitment to ESG principles, and its ability to manage complex regulatory environments to fund substantial infrastructure projects.1 The company faces typical industry challenges, including aging infrastructure, cybersecurity threats, regulatory complexities, and the need to adapt to an evolving energy landscape characterized by electrification and distributed energy resources.
Organizational Profile
1. Organization Overview
Full Legal Name and Corporate Structure:
The full legal name is Exelon Corporation.11
Exelon Corporation is a utility services holding company.2 Following the separation of its generation business in 2022, it operates primarily as a transmission and distribution utility holding company. Its corporate structure consists of the parent company, Exelon Corporation, and its six fully regulated utility subsidiaries:
Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd)
PECO Energy Company (PECO)
Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE)
Pepco Holdings LLC (PHI), which includes:
Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco)
Delmarva Power & Light Company (DPL)
Atlantic City Electric Company (ACE) 12
Analysis: This structure allows Exelon to focus on the regulated utility business, providing stable, predictable earnings, while each subsidiary addresses the specific regulatory and customer needs of its service territory.
Year Founded, Headquarters Location, and Significant Operational Locations:
Exelon Corporation was incorporated in 1999.2 Its formation was a result of the merger between PECO Energy Company and Unicom Corporation (parent of ComEd).
Headquarters: Chicago, Illinois.2 Specifically, 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.2
Significant Operational Locations: Operations are centered around the service territories of its six utilities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.3
Organizational History and Key Milestones:

Information Gap: Consistent 3-year trend for total annual revenues requires data from 2022, 2023, and 2024 10-K reports. The snippet 2 provides some revenue figures by segment, but their exact period (annual vs. projected) needs clarification from the full earnings report.
Employee Count: Approximately 20,014 people 2 or 20,000 employees.16 These figures are consistent as of early-mid 2025.
Market Capitalization: As of mid-2025, approximately $42.8 billion 18 to $43.03 billion.19 LTM Market Cap was $44.8B as of March 27, 2025.18

The service territories are primarily large urban and suburban areas.3
Information Gap: Specific customer counts for PECO, BGE, and each PHI utility are not detailed in the provided snippets, though the total is over 10.7 million. The 10-K report 14 would contain more precise figures.
Detailed Corporate Structure:
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: Exelon Corporation is the parent holding company. Its direct subsidiaries are its six regulated utilities: ComEd, PECO, BGE, and Pepco Holdings LLC (which in turn owns Pepco, DPL, and ACE).12 Exhibit 21.1 to 21.8 of the 10-K filings list these subsidiaries.13
Business Units and Divisions: The primary business units are the individual utility companies. Exelon also provides centralized corporate support services (legal, HR, IT, finance, etc.) to these operating companies.2
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: The most significant recent restructuring was the separation of Constellation Energy Group in February 2022, transforming Exelon into a pure-play regulated utility holding company.
Merger and Acquisition History:
Key Acquisitions: Constellation Energy (2012), Pepco Holdings Inc. (2016).
Key Divestitures/Separations: Separation of Constellation Energy Group (2022).
Analysis: The M&A history shows a period of expansion into generation and competitive markets, followed by a strategic refocusing on the regulated utility business. This shift aims to reduce earnings volatility and focus on steady, infrastructure-driven growth.
Ownership Structure:
Public Trading Information: Traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol EXC.2 IPO date listed as May 01, 1973 2 (this likely refers to one of its predecessor companies, as Exelon itself was formed in 1999/2000).
Major Shareholders:
Vanguard Group Inc. (approx. 11.31% - 12.42%) 22
BlackRock, Inc. (approx. 9.00%) 22
State Street Corp 22
Other significant institutional holders include Geode Capital Management, FMR LLC, Lazard Asset Management.22
Approximately 64.79% of stock owned by institutional investors.23
Private Equity Ownership Details: Not applicable; Exelon is a publicly traded company.
Recent Ownership Changes: Standard fluctuations in institutional holdings. For example, BlackRock's holdings decreased by 9.81% to 90.69 million shares as of April 2025, and Wellington Management Group LLP significantly decreased its holdings.22 Vanguard's holdings remained stable in a late 2024 filing.22
The focus on regulated utility operations post-Constellation separation positions Exelon for steady growth through significant planned capital expenditures. This strategic clarity is likely appealing to its predominantly institutional shareholder base. The company's large scale and diversified service territories across several states provide some insulation against localized economic or regulatory challenges, although it also means navigating multiple regulatory environments.

Operational decisions are delegated to utility presidents and functional VPs/Directors. Large capital projects and technology investments would involve cross-functional teams and rigorous review processes, especially given the regulated nature of the business and the scale of investments.
Known Approval Processes for Technology Purchases: Not explicitly detailed but would involve the CIO (Michael Brooks), relevant business unit leaders (e.g., utility CEOs if utility-specific), finance (Jeanne Jones for major expenditures), and potentially risk/compliance (David Glockner). Large investments would require Executive Committee and possibly Board approval.
Budget Authorities and Financial Approval Thresholds: Not publicly available.
Analysis: Decisions, particularly for significant technology and security investments, are likely to be methodical and data-driven, considering operational impact, risk reduction, regulatory compliance, and financial justification. The new CIO, Michael Brooks, will be a key influencer and decision-maker for IT and security-related purchases. The strong emphasis on risk management, evidenced by David Glockner's role and David DeWalt's board presence, suggests that security considerations are integral to technology decisions.

"Now/Next/Never" Prioritization:
Now: Focus on immediate threats to existing OT infrastructure, ensuring NERC CIP compliance, and securing the rapid build-out for data centers. This includes foundational OT visibility, threat detection, and robust IR capabilities.
Next: Strategic improvements such as maturing IT/OT converged security architecture, enhancing supply chain risk programs, and implementing advanced threat hunting.
Never: This category is generally not applicable to critical infrastructure security. Risks are managed and mitigated, not ignored.
Business Impact Mapping & Quantification: The value proposition should directly link security improvements to Exelon's key business drivers: reliability (avoiding outages), financial performance (protecting investments, avoiding fines), regulatory compliance, and enabling growth (securely connecting new loads).
Competitive Differentiation: Emphasize the unique combination of NCC Group's broad IT and specialized assessment capabilities with Dragos's world-leading OT/ICS threat detection, intelligence, and response platform. This integrated IT/OT approach is crucial for utilities. Highlight deep utility sector expertise and focus on actionable, intelligence-driven security.
Success Metrics:
Reduction in security incidents/near misses in OT environments.
Improved NERC CIP compliance audit outcomes.
Reduced mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) for OT threats.
Increased visibility of assets and vulnerabilities in OT networks.
Successful and secure integration of new grid assets (e.g., for data centers).
Positive feedback from operational teams and security leadership.
Strategic Engagement Plan
Initial Contact Approach (90-Day Engagement Timeline Focus):
Primary Contact Targets:
Michael Brooks (SVP & CIO): As the new CIO, he is the primary target. Initial outreach should focus on understanding his 90/180-day plans, key challenges, and vision for IT and cybersecurity at Exelon. Offer a strategic briefing on IT/OT cyber risk in the context of utility modernization and data center growth.
David Glockner (EVP, Compliance, Audit & Risk): Approach with a focus on risk management, NERC CIP compliance assurance, and governance for IT/OT security. Highlight expertise in mitigating risks associated with critical infrastructure.
David Bell (Director, Cyber Defense Operations): Engage on an operational level to discuss current threat landscape, detection/response capabilities, and how Dragos Platform/NCC services can enhance their existing SOC and IR functions.
Secondary Contact Targets (for broader context or later stages):
Carim V. Khouzami (EVP Transmission and Development): As Exelon invests heavily in transmission for data centers, his perspective on securing these new assets is crucial.
IT/OT leadership within the six operating companies (ComEd, PECO, BGE, PHI) for subsidiary-specific needs or pilot projects.
Outreach Messaging by Role:
CIO: Strategic alignment, enabling business objectives (growth, reliability), modernizing security alongside IT/OT infrastructure, managing risk for new initiatives (cloud, data centers).
EVP Risk/Compliance: Reducing risk exposure, ensuring robust NERC CIP compliance, enhancing cyber governance, board-level reporting confidence.
Director Cyber Defense: Enhancing operational capabilities, improving threat visibility and detection in OT, streamlining incident response, leveraging advanced threat intelligence.

Weeks 5-8: Conduct initial discovery sessions. Present tailored overview of NCC-Dragos capabilities. Identify potential pilot areas or assessment opportunities.
Weeks 9-12: Develop and present a proposal for a pilot project or initial assessment (e.g., OT visibility pilot with Dragos Platform, NERC CIP gap assessment, cloud security review for OCI/Azure).
Multi-Threading Strategy: Engage multiple stakeholders concurrently where appropriate, ensuring consistent messaging tailored to their roles. Coordinate efforts to build broad support.
Discovery Process:
Key Discovery Questions:
What are the CIO's top 3-5 priorities for the IT/cybersecurity organization in the next 12-18 months?
What are the biggest challenges in securing Exelon's OT environments, especially with ongoing modernization and data center integration?
How is Exelon currently approaching OT visibility and threat detection across its six utilities?
What are the key concerns regarding NERC CIP compliance and upcoming audits?
How is Exelon managing cybersecurity risks associated with its cloud adoption (OCI, Azure)?
What are the current incident response capabilities and plans for OT environments?
What are the perceived gaps in the current security vendor landscape?
