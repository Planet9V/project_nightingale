Go-to-Market Analysis: Port of San FranciscoGTM Analysis Part 1: 

Organization Profile & LeadershipTARGET ORGANIZATION: Port of San FranciscoExecutive SummaryThe Port of San Francisco operates as a semi-independent department of the City and County of San Francisco, entrusted with managing 7.5 miles of valuable waterfront property.1 Its organizational structure is characterized by governance from a five-member Port Commission, appointed by the Mayor, with day-to-day operations led by an Executive Director, currently Elaine Forbes.3 The Port's primary revenue streams are derived from extensive real estate holdings and diverse maritime operations, with a significant emphasis on cruise activities and specialized cargo handling, alongside a strong commitment to public access and historic preservation.1Recent years have seen the Port focus on post-COVID-19 economic recovery, undertaking major infrastructure initiatives such as the Seawall Resilience Program, and reinforcing its commitment to sustainability and equity.6 In the competitive landscape, the Port of San Francisco is a notable cruise destination on the U.S. West Coast. While its cargo operations are smaller in scale compared to regional giants like the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach and Oakland, it maintains a unique position through its diversified portfolio that encompasses significant real estate assets and popular public attractions.9 This multifaceted operational model presents both distinct opportunities and complex challenges, particularly in maintaining aging infrastructure and securing diverse revenue streams.1. Organization Overview

Full legal name and corporate structure:The official legal name as it appears in financial documents is the Port Commission, City and County of San Francisco, Port of San Francisco.12 It functions as a semi-independent organization, or more precisely, a department within the City and County of San Francisco.3 This unique governance model means that while it has a degree of operational autonomy, it remains an integral part of the broader municipal government structure. This relationship influences its funding mechanisms, policy directives, and procurement processes. The Port is governed by a five-member Port Commission, whose members are appointed by the Mayor of San Francisco and subsequently confirmed by the City's Board of Supervisors.1


Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations:The Port of San Francisco was established in 1863.15 Its headquarters is located at Pier 1, The Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA 94111.13 The Port's significant operational locations are extensive, spanning 7.5 miles of waterfront property.1 This territory includes internationally recognized landmarks and bustling commercial areas such as Fisherman’s Wharf, PIER 39, and the Ferry Building Marketplace. Its maritime operations are centered around cruise terminals at Pier 27 and Pier 35, and cargo terminals primarily at Pier 80, Pier 92, Pier 94, and Pier 96, alongside numerous other commercial leaseholds and public access spaces.1 The long history, signified by its 1863 establishment, and the vast, diverse waterfront properties it manages, point towards a complex array of assets and multifaceted operational requirements.


Organizational history and key milestones:The genesis of port activity in San Francisco dates back to 1835 with the establishment of the town of Yerba Buena under Mexican rule.18 A pivotal moment in its history was the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake, which catalyzed a new era of development, leading to the construction of modern piers and the Port becoming the only one in the United States under a single, unified control at that time.18 The majority of its existing facilities were constructed between 1878 and 1945, many of which are now recognized for their historical significance.19A crucial transformation occurred with the advent of containerization in the mid-20th century. The Port of Oakland, with its superior rail connections and ample backlands suitable for container stacking, became the Bay Area's primary container port.10 This shift led the Port of San Francisco to strategically pivot towards a mixed-use model, emphasizing real estate development, public access, tourism, and cruise operations, while retaining specialized cargo niches. The Burton Act of 1969 was a landmark piece of legislation that formally mandated the Port's current responsibilities, including promoting maritime commerce, navigation, fisheries, protecting natural resources, and developing recreational facilities.21 Understanding this historical evolution from a primary cargo port to its current diversified operational model is essential to grasp its contemporary revenue streams, strategic priorities, and the inherent challenges of managing historic, aging infrastructure.


Industry classification and primary business activities (with NAICS/SIC codes if available):The Port of San Francisco is classified under NAICS Code 488310 (Port and Harbor Operations).22 Corresponding SIC Codes include 4491 (Marine Cargo Handling) and 4499 (Water Transportation Services, NEC).22Its primary business activities are diverse, reflecting its mixed-use model:

Real Estate Development and Management: This is a major revenue driver, encompassing leases for commercial, retail, office, and industrial properties across its extensive waterfront holdings.1
Maritime Operations: This includes a significant cruise business, specialized cargo handling (such as automobiles, aggregates, and break-bulk cargo), commercial fishing operations, and ferry services.2
Public Access and Recreation: The Port manages numerous public parks, open spaces, and promenades, ensuring public enjoyment of the waterfront.2
Historic Preservation: Given the age of many of its facilities, historic preservation is an integral part of its management responsibilities.2
The breadth of these activities underscores a complex operational environment that extends far beyond traditional port functions, incorporating elements of urban development, tourism management, and cultural stewardship.



Precise company size metrics:

Annual revenue: The Port's financial performance shows a clear recovery trend following the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fiscal Year 2023 (ended June 30): Total Revenue reached $207,456,000. This comprised Operating Revenues of $128,667,000, Nonoperating Revenues of $39,420,000, and Capital Contributions of $39,369,000.6
Fiscal Year 2022 (ended June 30): Total Revenues were $118,684,000. This included Maritime revenues of $20,867,000, Real Estate & Asset Management revenues of $87,265,000, Interest Income of $2,779,000, and Other Revenue of $7,772,000.25
Fiscal Year 2021 (ended June 30): Total Revenues were $91,060,000, significantly impacted by the pandemic.25 This included Maritime revenues of $15,147,000, Real Estate & Asset Management revenues of $68,944,000, Interest Income of $2,299,000, and Other Revenue of $4,672,000. The Port received substantial state stimulus funds to offset these pandemic-induced revenue losses.6


Employee count: As of its 2024 Impact Report, the Port of San Francisco has 276 employees.26 This figure is for the Port itself, which is one of several enterprise departments within the City and County of San Francisco's much larger workforce.27
Market capitalization if publicly traded: Not applicable, as the Port is a department of the City and County of San Francisco and is not publicly traded.
Growth rate and financial trajectory: The revenue figures demonstrate a strong recovery and growth trajectory post-pandemic. However, the Port faces significant long-term capital needs, with a reported $1.994 billion state of good repair (SOGR) investment requirement, of which $1.49 billion is currently unfunded.29
The financial data indicates resilience and an upward trend in revenue, yet the substantial unfunded capital liabilities for infrastructure maintenance and upgrades present a persistent challenge. This financial pressure suggests a continuous focus on operational efficiency, maximizing revenue from its diverse assets, and actively seeking external funding sources such as grants and strategic partnerships. Consequently, any new expenditures, including those for cybersecurity, will likely be scrutinized for clear return on investment, risk mitigation capabilities that protect revenue, or their ability to satisfy conditions often attached to grants and other funding mechanisms. The relatively small employee count for an entity managing such extensive and diverse assets also suggests a reliance on contractors and shared City services.



Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations:The Port's jurisdiction covers 7.5 miles of San Francisco's eastern waterfront, stretching from Fisherman’s Wharf in the north to Bayview/Hunters Point in the south.1 Within this extensive area, the Port manages over 550 leases for ground, commercial, retail, office, industrial, and maritime uses.1Key landmark properties and operational hubs under its purview include:

Tourist and Public Attractions: Fisherman’s Wharf, PIER 39, the Ferry Building Marketplace, and Oracle Park (home of the San Francisco Giants, formerly AT&T Park).1
Cruise Operations: Primary cruise terminals are located at Pier 27, with Pier 35 used for overflow and transit calls.11
Cargo Operations: Specialized cargo facilities are situated at Pier 80 (vehicle processing, break-bulk), Pier 92 and Pier 94 (dry bulk, such as sand and aggregates), and Pier 96 (marketed for various cargo opportunities, with deep-water berth and on-dock rail).5
Commercial and Industrial Real Estate: Various piers and land parcels are leased for diverse commercial and industrial activities, including the historic Pier 70 redevelopment area.1
Public Open Space: The Port manages 107 acres of public open space, including parks and promenades along the waterfront.26
The sheer diversity and geographic spread of these assets—ranging from high-traffic public attractions and tenanted commercial spaces to operational maritime facilities—imply a complex set of security requirements. These needs encompass not only physical security but also cybersecurity to protect operational systems, tenant data, and public-facing services across numerous distributed locations.



Detailed corporate structure including:

Parent-subsidiary relationships: The Port of San Francisco is a department of its parent entity, the City and County of San Francisco.3 It does not operate traditional corporate subsidiaries.
Business units and divisions: The Port's operational structure is organized into several key divisions, generally headed by Deputy Directors. These include Planning and Environment, Maritime, Maintenance, Real Estate & Development, Engineering, and Finance and Administration. An Executive Office also exists, encompassing functions such as Communications, Legal counsel, Human Resources, and Commission affairs.2 This divisional structure clearly reflects the Port's core functions and diverse responsibilities.
Recent restructuring initiatives: No major organizational restructuring initiatives have been prominently featured in recent public information. However, there is an ongoing process of adaptation in the post-COVID environment, with a focus on economic recovery and operational efficiency, as outlined in its strategic plans.6
Merger and acquisition history: In a traditional corporate sense, M&A is not applicable. However, the Port has expanded its operational responsibilities at times, for example, by acquiring the operations of South Beach Harbor.6



Ownership structure:The Port of San Francisco is publicly owned. It is managed by the Port Commission and operates as an enterprise department of the City and County of San Francisco.1 It is not a publicly traded entity and has no private equity ownership. This public ownership model dictates a high degree of transparency in its operations, adherence to specific public procurement processes, and an environment where decisions can be influenced by political considerations and public sentiment.

Jenica Liu, Commission Affairs Manager & Assistant to the Director:.2

This executive team's collective experience spans public administration, finance, real estate, law, and urban development. Understanding their individual backgrounds, tenures, and specific areas of focus is critical for tailoring engagement strategies and addressing their respective priorities.


Board of Directors (Port Commission):The Port Commission is the governing body of the Port of San Francisco, composed of five members. Each commissioner is appointed by the Mayor of San Francisco and must be confirmed by the City's Board of Supervisors. Commissioners serve four-year terms and are responsible for the oversight of the Port's 7.5 miles of waterfront, including its development, marketing, leasing, administration, and management.1As of the latest available information:

Gail Gilman, President: Appointed in April 2018, with her current term expiring in May 2026. Ms. Gilman is the CEO and President of CCH (Christian Church Homes), an affordable housing developer. She brings over 25 years of executive experience in policy, strategy, and real estate development focused on reducing homelessness. Her previous work involved senior roles in organizations financing and building affordable housing. She has served on numerous housing and homeless task forces and was appointed to California's Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council. Ms. Gilman holds a Master's degree in Nonprofit Administration from the University of San Francisco and a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from San Francisco State University.37 Note: Some meeting agendas from early 2025 list Kimberly Brandon as President 31; however, the Port's official commissioner bios page 37, updated July 2024, lists Gail Gilman as President. This report will proceed with Ms. Gilman as the current President based on the more recent direct source.
Stephen Engblom, Vice President: Appointed in July 2024, with his term expiring in May 2028. Mr. Engblom is a registered architect and urban planner with extensive urban design experience as an executive and faculty member at UC Berkeley. He has over two decades of experience in urban design and architectural projects globally. Previously, he was a Senior Managing Director at CBRE, where he established their first public sector practice, and an Executive Vice President at AECOM, leading AECOM Cities. He currently runs his own consultancy focused on housing and teaches at UC Berkeley’s College of Environmental Design.37
Willie Adams, Commissioner: Appointed in July 2012, with his term expiring in May 2026. Mr. Adams has a long and distinguished career with the International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU), which he has presided over as International President since 2018. He has previously served as the Port Commission's Vice President and President multiple times.37
Steven Lee, Commissioner: Appointed in July 2022, with his term expiring in May 2026. Mr. Lee brings decades of experience as an entrepreneur with a background in branding. He has been a prominent advocate for San Francisco's nightlife industry for 20 years and is a recognized leader within the API Community and Chinatown. He previously served on the San Francisco Entertainment Commission.37
Kimberly Brandon: While listed as President in some 2025 meeting documents 31, her current specific role on the commission requires clarification against the latest official bios.
Information regarding standing committees of the Port Commission and specific member assignments was not detailed in the available materials.1 Port Commission meetings do include closed sessions, particularly for negotiations related to real property.31 The diverse backgrounds of the commissioners—spanning affordable housing, urban planning, labor, and local business advocacy—suggest a multifaceted approach to decision-making. The Mayor's office wields considerable influence through these appointments. Major strategic decisions or significant expenditures undertaken by the Port likely necessitate alignment, whether formal or informal, with the broader priorities of the Mayor for the City and County of San Francisco, especially concerning economic development, public funds, and resilience initiatives. This connection is evidenced by joint announcements and the Mayor's involvement in promoting Port-related projects and grant acquisitions.35



IT and Security leadership:The structure for Information Technology (IT) and Cybersecurity leadership at the Port of San Francisco appears to be integrated within its broader administrative framework and connected to city-wide technology governance, rather than featuring standalone C-level IT/Security executives at the Port level.

CIO/CTO Equivalent: The Port does not have an explicitly titled Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO). IT functions are managed under the Finance and Administration Division.2

Nate Cruz (CFO) has executive oversight of the IT department as part of his broader responsibilities.33
Meghan Wallace (Interim Deputy Director of Finance and Administration) also shares oversight of IT functions.34
A critical role, Information Systems (IS) Director (classified as Manager V, 0933), was under recruitment with an application deadline of June 17, 2024.14 This individual will report to the Finance and Administration Division and will be responsible for planning, directing, and coordinating all information system operations and activities. This includes system design, development, implementation, and the coordination of data and information systems across Port departments. The IS Director will oversee two distinct groups: an applications group (for implementing and maintaining tailored technology applications) and an infrastructure group (ensuring a stable and secure environment for desktop and mobile devices).14 The successful candidate for this role will be a key contact for NCC Group.


CISO Equivalent: A dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for the Port is not listed. Cybersecurity responsibilities are likely distributed and coordinated with city-level entities.

The City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) has an Office of Cybersecurity that sets city-wide policies and provides support.40 Michael Makstman, the former CCSF CISO, is now the City CIO, indicating a strong cybersecurity understanding at the city's technology leadership level.41
The CCSF Cybersecurity Policy mandates that all city departments, including the Port, appoint a Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO) to coordinate cybersecurity efforts within their respective department.42 Identifying the individual serving as the Port's DISO is a crucial step for targeted engagement.
The Port also has a role for a Security and Emergency Planning Manager. While the current incumbent is not explicitly named in staff lists, a job description for this position indicates responsibility for overseeing security management, emergency planning and response, liaising with law enforcement and other governmental agencies, and managing budgets for emergency preparedness and Port security projects.21 This role would have significant interface with cybersecurity matters, particularly concerning physical security convergence and incident response.


Digital transformation leadership: Strategic digital transformation initiatives are likely driven by the Executive Director (Elaine Forbes) and COO (Michael Martin), in conjunction with the CFO (Nate Cruz) and the future IS Director. These efforts will align with the Port's strategic plan goals related to operational efficiency, system modernization, and enhanced public engagement.8

The current IT and security leadership configuration, with responsibilities nested under Finance and Administration and a reliance on a departmental DISO interfacing with the city's central cybersecurity apparatus, suggests that cybersecurity historically may have been viewed more as an operational management component and a matter of city-wide compliance, rather than a distinct, board-level strategic imperative within the Port itself. However, the explicit mandate for the new IS Director to overhaul "numerous, unintegrated, and under-supported systems" 14 and the Port's broader focus on resilience 8 are elevating the strategic importance of robust IT and cybersecurity. This evolving landscape presents an opportunity for NCC Group to position cybersecurity not merely as a technical necessity but as a critical business enabler and risk mitigator, directly supporting the financial health, operational continuity, and strategic objectives prioritized by the Port's senior leadership, particularly the CFO and COO.


Middle management in relevant departments:Identifying specific middle managers is crucial for understanding day-to-day operations and potential points of entry for technical discussions.

IT Infrastructure/Operations Managers: The future IS Director will oversee an infrastructure group and an applications group.14 The specific managers leading these groups below the IS Director level are not detailed in the provided information but would be important contacts.
Security Operations Managers: These responsibilities likely reside with the Port's DISO or under the Security and Emergency Planning Manager.
Procurement and Vendor Management Contacts: The Finance and Administration Division is responsible for Contracts and Procurement.2 Oversight would come from Meghan Wallace (Interim Deputy Director) and Nate Cruz (CFO). Specific procurement officers or managers within this division would handle vendor interactions.
Property Management Contacts: For real estate related systems or security, key contacts include Kimberley Beal (Director of Property Management). Specific property managers for distinct waterfront areas like Fisherman’s Wharf (Harold George II) and the Northeast Waterfront (Sandra Oberle) could also be relevant depending on the scope of engagement.43



Decision-making patterns:

Organizational decision structures: The Port Commission holds the ultimate authority for approving major leases, significant policy changes, and overall budget allocations.1 The Executive Director, along with her executive team, manages daily operations and formulates recommendations that are presented to the Commission for consideration and approval.
Known approval processes for technology purchases: Technology acquisitions, particularly those of significant scale, would likely involve a multi-stage approval process. This would start with the IS Director (once in place) and require endorsement from the CFO (Nate Cruz) and potentially the COO (Michael Martin). Final approval authority would rest with the Executive Director (Elaine Forbes) or the Port Commission, contingent on the expenditure's size and strategic importance. All procurement must align with the City and County of San Francisco's established policies and procedures. Chapter 6 contracting regulations are specifically mentioned as applicable to the Port.44
Budget authorities and financial approval thresholds: The CFO and the Executive Director have primary responsibility for budget management, with the Port Commission approving the overall biennial budget.45 Specific financial approval thresholds for different levels of management are not detailed but would be standard for a public agency of its size.
Understanding this multi-layered approval process, which incorporates both Port-level leadership and overarching City and County regulations, is essential for accurately forecasting sales cycle durations and navigating the procurement landscape.

Recent News and Developments (Past 18 Months)An analysis of the Port of San Francisco's activities and announcements over the last 18 months (approximately December 2023 onwards) reveals a dynamic organization focused on revitalization, sustainability, infrastructure enhancement, and community engagement.

Comprehensive news analysis:Key themes emerging from press releases and major announcements include a strong emphasis on the revitalization and development of Fisherman’s Wharf, with initiatives to revive vacant restaurant spaces and create new cultural venues like artist studios.35 Sustainability and green initiatives are also prominent, highlighted by the "Clean Fleet Experience" and a significant $55 million federal grant to advance a zero-emission ferry service.35Economic development and support for maritime industries are evident through actions like facilitating off-the-boat crab sales, installing new infrastructure for the crab fleet, and approving rent relief programs for crab and salmon processors.35 Furthermore, the Port is actively pursuing infrastructure improvement and climate resilience, notably through a draft plan with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build flood defenses against sea level rise.35 Community engagement and the enhancement of public spaces are demonstrated by the unveiling of the new Fisherman’s Wharf Promenade and the grand opening of Bayfront Park in Mission Bay.35The Port, not being a publicly traded company, does not have traditional earnings calls. Its financial performance and priorities are communicated through annual reports, budget documents, and public Commission meetings.6 Local news outlets provide ongoing commentary on Port developments and their impact on the city.46


Strategic initiatives:The Port’s direction is guided by its 2021-2025 Strategic Plan, which prioritizes seven key goals: Economic Recovery, Economic Growth, Equity, Resilience, Sustainability, Evolution (of the waterfront), and Engagement.8 These themes are consistent with previous strategic plans (2016-2021 and 2019-2023), indicating a long-term commitment to these areas, with evolving specific actions.47The FY21 Annual Report, for instance, emphasized post-pandemic economic recovery, advancing equity initiatives to create a "waterfront for all," and making progress on critical resilience projects like the Embarcadero Seawall.7 Executive Director Elaine Forbes consistently articulates a vision for a "safe, clean, and vibrant waterfront" that balances economic activation with affordable housing, climate adaptation measures through the Waterfront Resilience Program, and a strong commitment to equity.4 These strategic initiatives inherently carry cybersecurity implications, such as the need to protect new technological investments supporting these goals, ensure the operational continuity of critical services during resilience projects, and secure sensitive data related to equity programs and tenant information.


Organizational changes:The Port has experienced several notable leadership appointments in the recent period. Stephen Engblom was appointed as a Port Commissioner and Vice President in July 2024.37 Scott Landsittel took on the role of Deputy Director of Real Estate and Development in January 2024, and Eric Young was appointed Director of Communications in October 2023.35Significantly, the Port has been actively recruiting for key technical leadership positions. The recruitment for an Information Systems (IS) Director (Manager V classification) had a closing date of June 2024 14, and recruitment for a Deputy Director of Engineering was open with a deadline of March 2025.44These recent appointments, particularly in pivotal areas like Real Estate/Development and Communications, coupled with the active search for new leadership in critical technical roles (IS Director and Deputy Director of Engineering), suggest a period of organizational refresh. New leaders in these positions often bring new perspectives and are typically empowered to review existing systems, strategies, and security postures. This can create a window of opportunity for engagement, as these individuals may be more receptive to implementing new solutions or adopting different approaches to meet their mandates. NCC Group could find it highly effective to engage with these new hires early in their tenure, positioning themselves as strategic partners in achieving initial objectives.


Financial developments:The Port has been successful in securing external funding for key projects. This includes a $55 million federal grant for a high-speed zero-emission ferry service (announced November 2024) and a $9.6 million federal grant for critical southern waterfront infrastructure (announced November 2022).35 State funding was also obtained in July 2023 to support increased cargo shipping, boost economic activity, and develop a greener southern waterfront.35 Critically, the Port received $117 million in state stimulus funds to mitigate revenue losses sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic.6Major ongoing investments include the multi-phase Seawall Resilience Program and various Embarcadero Seawall early projects.7 A $2.2 million investment into Fisherman’s Wharf beautification was approved in July 2023.35 The Port operates with a Capital Improvement Program (FY2024-2029) and a Ten-Year Capital Plan (2026-2035) to guide these expenditures.24In response to post-COVID financial pressures, the Port has focused on stabilizing its finances, which included a revision of its reserve policy to increase the operating reserve from 15% to 50% of annual operating expenses.6 This indicates prudent financial management alongside a strategy that heavily relies on grants and public funds for major capital projects.

This timeline highlights key activities and changes, offering NCC Group specific contexts for initiating conversations and aligning their value proposition with the Port's current priorities and operational realities.4. Competitive LandscapeThe Port of San Francisco operates in a dynamic and competitive environment, facing different sets of competitors across its varied business lines, including cargo, cruise operations, and commercial real estate.

Detailed competitor analysis:

Cargo Operations: In the realm of cargo, particularly containerized goods, the Port of San Francisco is a niche player on the West Coast. The dominant container ports in California are the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, which together handle a vast majority of the state's and a significant portion of the nation's container traffic.50 The Port of Oakland serves as the primary container port for the San Francisco Bay Area, having surpassed San Francisco in this segment due to geographical advantages and earlier investment in container handling infrastructure.10 Further north, the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma (The Northwest Seaport Alliance - NWSA) are also major players in West Coast container trade.50
The Port of San Francisco's cargo activities are focused on specialized segments such as automobiles (import/export at Pier 80), aggregates and other dry bulk cargoes (Piers 92 and 94) primarily for regional construction, and break-bulk cargo.5 Its market share in overall West Coast cargo TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) is minimal compared to the container giants; for instance, the Port of Los Angeles alone handles over 8-9 million TEUs annually, and Oakland over 2 million TEUs 51, while San Francisco's volumes are not typically reported in these terms, reflecting its different cargo focus. The Port of Los Angeles reportedly holds about 41% of the West Coast market share for container cargo.55
Cruise Operations: The Port of San Francisco is a significant cruise port on the West Coast, handling approximately 365,000 to 400,000 passengers annually.11 Key competitors in this sector include the Port of Los Angeles (which handled over 1.3 million passengers in 2023 56), the Port of Seattle (a major gateway for Alaskan cruises, serving over 1.7 million passengers annually 9), and the Port of San Diego (which focuses more on smaller, luxury, and expedition-class vessels 9).
Real Estate and Tourism: In its capacity as a landlord and manager of public attractions, the Port competes with other commercial real estate entities and waterfront attractions within the vibrant San Francisco market. While third-party tools list entities like Mi Vida Wharf or Pick a Pier as general alternatives 58, these are less direct competitors to the Port's overall governance and diverse asset management role.

The Port's market position is thus characterized by its status as a prominent cruise destination and a significant manager of iconic public and commercial spaces, rather than a leader in cargo volume. Its competitive advantages lie in its world-renowned iconic location, the diversity of its revenue streams (spanning maritime, real estate, and tourism), strong public engagement, and the unique appeal of its historic assets. For the cruise industry, San Francisco is a highly desirable destination in itself. For its niche cargo operations, such as aggregates for local construction projects, its strategic location within the Bay Area is an advantage.Conversely, competitive disadvantages include the challenges of maintaining aging infrastructure, the high operational costs associated with its San Francisco location, limited land availability for significant cargo expansion (especially compared to Oakland, Los Angeles, or Long Beach), and inherent seismic risks.


Industry standing:While specific industry rankings or awards for the Port of San Francisco were not detailed in the provided information (unlike NWSA, which received Logistics Management's Quest for Quality Awards 59), it is an internationally recognized name and a key entity within California's port ecosystem. Historically, it lost substantial cargo market share to the Port of Oakland with the rise of containerization.10 Its cruise market share is respectable, though it faces strong competition from other West Coast ports. The Port is likely an active member of key industry associations such as the California Association of Port Authorities (CAPA), evidenced by a visit from the CA State Transportation Secretary and CAPA mentioned in its news 35, and the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA).


Market challenges:The Port of San Francisco confronts typical industry-specific challenges, including the ever-present risk of supply chain disruptions (though its niche cargo focus may offer some insulation compared to major container ports), intense competition from other West Coast ports continuously upgrading their facilities and services, the ongoing need for significant infrastructure modernization, and compliance with stringent environmental regulations. The threat of sea level rise poses a particularly acute long-term challenge to its waterfront assets.Disruptive market forces include the trend towards larger container ships, which primarily benefits ports with deeper drafts and more extensive handling infrastructure, and the evolving demands of the cruise industry, such as the need for larger berths and shore power capabilities. The consolidation within global shipping line alliances also impacts all ports by altering service patterns and negotiating power.52
The Port's reliance on a diverse portfolio—spanning maritime activities, extensive real estate holdings, and major tourist attractions—is a strategic strength that provides multiple revenue streams. However, this operational diversity also creates a broader and more varied attack surface from a cybersecurity perspective, encompassing a wider range of potential operational risks. While it ceded dominance in bulk containerized cargo to Oakland, its current model, which heavily emphasizes cruise tourism, specialized cargo, and the management of numerous real estate leases and public venues, means that its "critical infrastructure" extends beyond cargo cranes. It includes passenger terminals, tenant data systems, public safety communication systems, and building management systems for many historic and modern properties.1 This complexity presents a significant challenge for the Port in terms of comprehensive security management but concurrently offers an opportunity for a cybersecurity provider like NCC Group, capable of addressing threats across IT, Operational Technology (OT) in building management and physical security systems, and compliance requirements across this varied landscape.


Strategic differentiation:The Port of San Francisco positions its brand as "The City's Connection to the Bay" 15 and as a gateway to a world-class city that advances environmentally and financially sustainable maritime, recreational, and economic opportunities.8 Its unique selling propositions are deeply intertwined with its iconic waterfront location, its stewardship of historic landmarks, the diverse range of attractions it hosts, and its strong focus on public access.The Port's core competencies include sophisticated real estate management, public space development and activation, cruise operations management, historic preservation, and navigating a complex multi-stakeholder environment involving tenants, city agencies, community groups, and the public. It differentiates itself primarily through this unique blend of commerce, public service, and historical significance, rather than by sheer cargo throughput.

This comparative snapshot illustrates the Port of San Francisco's unique position. It competes not on sheer volume of containerized cargo but on the value of its diverse assets and its role as a premier urban waterfront destination. This understanding is crucial for NCC Group to tailor its cybersecurity value proposition to the Port's specific operational profile and strategic priorities, which differ significantly from those of a pure high-volume cargo port.5. Corporate Culture and ValuesThe corporate culture and values of the Port of San Francisco are deeply rooted in its public service mandate and its role as a steward of a vital and historic part of the city.

Stated mission, vision, and values:

Mission: "The Port of San Francisco manages the waterfront as the gateway to a world-class city, and advances environmentally and financially sustainable maritime, recreational and economic opportunities to serve the City, Bay Area region, and California".8
Vision: "The Port of San Francisco delivers vibrant and diverse experiences that enrich the City and San Francisco Bay".8
Values/Strategic Goals: The Port's strategic plans consistently emphasize core values through its goals. The 2021-2025 Strategic Plan identifies Economic Recovery, Economic Growth, Equity, Resilience, Sustainability, Evolution, and Engagement as its guiding principles.8 Earlier plans (2016-2021) highlighted similar themes such as Renewal, Engagement, Livability, Resiliency, Sustainability, and Economic Vitality.47
A particularly strong value explicitly articulated in the 2021 Annual Report and other communications is Equity. The Port aims to "enshrine equity as a core Port value among staff to create an inclusive workplace" and is committed to being an "explicitly anti-racist" organization.7 Furthermore, the Port officially acknowledges and pays respect to the Ramaytush Ohlone people as the original inhabitants of the land, affirming their sovereign rights.61
This strong public emphasis on equity, sustainability, community engagement, and resilience suggests a culture that prioritizes collaborative partnerships, long-term societal impact, and solutions that align with these broader objectives. Sales approaches that demonstrate how NCC Group's services directly support these values—for instance, by securing systems that ensure equitable access to Port services, protecting critical infrastructure vital for community resilience, or supporting sustainable IT practices—may resonate more effectively than pitches focused solely on technical features or cost. Public agencies like the Port, with a significant community interface, often make decisions that weigh wider stakeholder impacts alongside financial considerations. The consistent and prominent articulation of "equity," "sustainability," and "resilience" in strategic documents 8 and leadership statements 4 indicates these are not mere aspirations but deeply ingrained operational principles.



Corporate social responsibility initiatives:CSR is not a peripheral activity for the Port but is woven into its strategic fabric. Key initiatives include:

Equity Programs: A strong focus on empowering Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) in Port operations and business opportunities, creating pathways for economically disadvantaged communities, and implementing a Racial Equity Action Plan.7 This includes ensuring equal access to real estate, leasing, and contract opportunities for BIPOC-owned and local business enterprises.8
Environmental Stewardship: The Port is committed to a Climate Action Plan with a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, alongside initiatives for Bay health protection and the development of resilient infrastructure like the Seawall Program and the Living Seawall pilot project.7
Community Engagement: Efforts are directed towards ensuring broad public access to the waterfront and activating parks and open spaces in ways that attract and serve diverse communities.8



Diversity and inclusion programs:D&I is a highly visible and explicitly stated priority. The Port has implemented a Racial Equity Action Plan, established Equity Champions within the organization, and actively participates in events like Juneteenth on the Waterfront.7 Strategic goals are in place to foster diverse leadership, ensure equitable recruitment, hiring, and retention practices, and connect resilient communities to waterfront open spaces.8 The commitment to being an "anti-racist organization" is reiterated in official documents and even in job postings, signaling its importance to the organizational identity.7


Environmental and sustainability commitments:Sustainability and environmental resilience are central to the Port's long-term strategy, driven by both ecological concerns and the physical vulnerabilities of its waterfront assets. Key commitments include the comprehensive Waterfront Resilience Program (addressing seismic risks and sea level rise) 7, a Sustainability Framework and Climate Action Plan (targeting net-zero GHG emissions by 2050), initiatives for electrification of operations (e.g., "Clean Fleet Experience" 35), water conservation, and projects aimed at protecting Bay health and promoting natural infrastructure.8


Corporate communications style:As a public agency, the Port of San Francisco maintains a communication style that is public-facing, transparent, and community-oriented. This is evident through its regular issuance of news releases 35, active social media presence 13, and publicly accessible Port Commission meetings with detailed agendas and minutes.1 Strategic plans, financial reports, and other key documents are readily available on its website, reflecting a commitment to transparency and public engagement, which are also stated goals in its strategic plan.8


Employee review themes from platforms like Glassdoor:Direct employee reviews for the "Port of San Francisco" specifically were not available in the provided research materials. General job search platform snippets for other organizations or broad discussions about unrelated entities (e.g., SF SPCA on Reddit 62) do not offer specific insights into the Port's internal employee sentiment. However, the Port of Oakland, a comparable public port agency in the Bay Area, is described positively by its employees as dynamic and complex, offering good compensation, benefits, and a sense of community impact.63 The Port of San Francisco's own recruitment language emphasizes a commitment to fostering a workplace rooted in "inclusion, transparency, and respect," and dedication to being an "anti-racist organization where equity and diversity are integral to our success".44 This sets a positive expectation for its internal culture, though it represents an information gap regarding direct employee feedback.


Leadership communication patterns from public sources:Public statements from Executive Director Elaine Forbes consistently align with the Port's strategic vision, emphasizing resilience, equity, economic vitality, and community benefit.4 Communications from the Port Commission, through its public meetings and documented proceedings, are formal, structured, and reflect adherence to public agency protocols.1 This pattern indicates that leadership communication is generally consistent with the Port's stated mission and strategic priorities.


Recognition and awards for corporate culture:Specific awards or formal recognition received by the Port of San Francisco for its corporate culture were not identified in the available research. This represents another minor information gap.

Engagement Recommendations (Preliminary)Based on this initial organizational profile, preliminary recommendations for NCC Group's engagement strategy include:
Key stakeholders to approach: Initial outreach should target the Executive Director (Elaine Forbes), the Chief Financial Officer (Nate Cruz), the incoming Information Systems Director (once appointed), the Port's Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO, once identified), and the Security and Emergency Planning Manager. Relevant Deputy Directors, such as those for Maritime or Real Estate & Development, may also be key depending on the specific operational risks and solutions being discussed.
Organizational entry points: Leverage any existing relationships NCC Group may have within the City and County of San Francisco. Monitor for and respond to relevant Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Proactive, value-driven outreach to newly appointed leadership, particularly the incoming IS Director, could be effective.
Relationship-building strategy: Focus on demonstrating a deep understanding of the Port's unique challenges and strategic objectives, especially concerning resilience, economic recovery, and operational continuity. Emphasize a partnership approach rather than a purely transactional one.
Communication approach: Communications should align with the Port's publicly stated values. Emphasize partnership, the development of long-term solutions, and how robust cybersecurity can reduce risk and directly support their public service mission and strategic goals like resilience and equity.
Timing considerations: The onboarding of the new Information Systems Director will be a critical period. The Port's budget cycle, with the fiscal year starting July 1st 6, should be factored into planning. Align engagement with timelines for major projects, such as the ongoing Seawall Resilience Program and other capital improvements.

GTM Analysis Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security PostureTARGET ORGANIZATION: Port of San FranciscoExecutive SummaryThe Port of San Francisco's technical environment is a complex amalgamation, supporting diverse business operations including finance, extensive real estate leasing, maritime activities, and public services. It likely comprises a mix of enterprise IT systems and various Operational Technology (OT) or Industrial Control Systems (ICS) for facility management, physical security, and pier operations. Significant modernization efforts for these systems are either underway or planned, driven by a new Information Systems Director role tasked with developing a cohesive strategic systems plan.14From a security perspective, the Port operates under the cybersecurity policy framework of the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), which includes the mandatory appointment of a Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO) and recommends alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.42 However, specific details of the Port's dedicated security program and team structure require further investigation. Critical technical challenges include the integration of disparate and potentially legacy applications, securing a wide array of assets spread across 7.5 miles of waterfront (including piers, historic buildings, and public spaces), and managing IT and security considerations for over 550 tenants.1 The current vendor landscape for specific IT and security solutions is not extensively detailed in public information, suggesting an opportunity for new partnerships. Primary security threats and risks encompass ransomware attacks, data breaches involving sensitive tenant, passenger, or employee information, the disruption of maritime operations (particularly cruise and specialized cargo), threats to public safety systems, and vulnerabilities inherent in aging infrastructure that may include OT components.1. Technology Infrastructure

Detailed technology stack analysis:

Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, etc.): The Port's Finance and Administration Division holds responsibility for the development and maintenance of its business applications.2 A key deliverable for the incoming Information Systems (IS) Director will be the creation of a comprehensive systems strategic plan. This plan aims to align disparate systems with the Port's core business requirements and ensure integration with citywide financial and payroll systems.14 This directive implies the existence of established systems for critical functions such as finance, human resources, and likely specialized applications for leasing and property management. The Port's 2021-2025 Strategic Plan specifically mentioned planned technology projects including an "asset management system replacement by 2024, lease pipeline system in 2022, PropWorks space module by 2023, and GIS upgrade in 2022," further indicating ongoing or recent efforts to manage its enterprise data.8 The specific names and vendors of the core ERP, CRM, or dedicated property management software currently in use represent an information gap that would be beneficial to fill for a more granular understanding.
Cloud services and providers in use: The broader City and County of San Francisco, under its CIO Michael Makstman, is strategically focused on "implementing more cloud-based solutions that are easily available and cost-effective".41 This city-level directive suggests that the Port may also be actively migrating to or considering cloud services for enhanced scalability, resilience, and potential cost efficiencies. However, specific cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) or the particular SaaS applications utilized by the Port are not detailed in publicly available information.
Network architecture: Responsibility for the Port's local area network (LAN) also resides within the Finance and Administration Division.2 The infrastructure group, to be managed by the new IS Director, will be tasked with ensuring a "stable and secure environment for desktop and mobile devices".14 While this confirms standard network infrastructure is in place, detailed public information on the specific architecture is not available.
Data center locations and capabilities: The City and County of San Francisco's Department of Technology is responsible for managing city data centers.41 It is plausible that the Port leverages these centralized municipal facilities for some of its applications, which would imply shared infrastructure and potentially coordinated security responsibilities with the city's central IT department. The Port might also maintain localized server rooms for specific operational needs or legacy systems.
Hardware and software vendors: Detailed information on specific hardware (servers, networking equipment) and overarching software vendors is not extensively provided. However, operational areas like cargo handling do mention specific equipment, such as Paceco and Hyundai/Paceco cranes with defined capacities 5, indicating the presence of OT components and associated vendors in those specialized environments. A mix of common IT and more specialized OT vendors is anticipated across the Port's diverse operations.
Legacy systems and modernization efforts: A significant driver for the Port's current technology strategy is the need to address legacy systems. The job description for the incoming IS Director explicitly states the challenge of transforming "numerous, unintegrated, and under-supported systems to fewer, better-integrated systems" and highlights the necessity of leading "major system replacements or upgrades".14 This is reinforced by the strategic plan's enumeration of specific modernization projects like the asset management system replacement.8 This clear acknowledgment of existing technical debt and the active pursuit of modernization create a prime opportunity for cybersecurity service providers. Such transformative projects inherently require robust security to be integrated from the design phase to protect new investments, ensure data integrity during migration, and establish a secure foundation for future operations. Organizations undergoing such transitions are often more receptive to new security solutions and advisory services that can help them achieve a "secure by design" posture, rather than attempting to retrofit security measures onto already deployed systems.



Operational Technology (OT) environments:

Industrial control systems (ICS) in use: The Port's OT landscape is primarily associated with supporting its diverse facility management and maritime operational needs, rather than heavy industrial processes found in manufacturing or energy generation. Key areas include:

Cargo handling equipment, such as gantry cranes at Pier 80 and Piers 94/96.5
Building Automation Systems (BAS) or Building Management Systems (BMS) for a multitude of managed properties, including historic piers, the Ferry Building, and various commercial tenant spaces. These systems control HVAC, lighting, and other environmental factors.
Physical security systems, including extensive CCTV surveillance networks, access control systems (PACS), and intrusion detection systems across the 7.5-mile waterfront, covering public areas, tenant leaseholds, and restricted maritime zones.
Systems for managing utilities (e.g., electricity, water) distributed across Port properties, including shore power for cruise ships.


SCADA systems and protocols: SCADA systems are likely employed for monitoring and controlling distributed assets, such as utility infrastructure and potentially elements of the BAS/BMS across the geographically dispersed Port properties. Specific systems and communication protocols are not publicly detailed.
IoT deployments and connected devices: There is significant potential for Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. These could include smart building technologies within managed properties, environmental sensors (e.g., for the Living Seawall pilot project 7), public Wi-Fi access points, smart parking solutions, and an increasing number of IP-based security cameras and access control readers.
OT/IT convergence initiatives: The strategic initiative to integrate various systems under the new IS Director 14 will inevitably touch upon OT/IT convergence. This is particularly relevant if asset management systems are being centralized or if physical security systems are being modernized and networked with IT infrastructure for improved monitoring and data analysis. As the Port modernizes its overall technology landscape, the traditional separation between IT and OT systems—especially in areas like building management, physical security, and utility monitoring—will likely diminish. This convergence increases the attack surface and necessitates integrated security approaches that span both domains.

While the Port of San Francisco is not a traditional heavy industrial site like a power plant or a large-scale manufacturing facility, its extensive real estate portfolio, encompassing over 550 leases 1 and numerous historic structures 19 alongside modern public attractions, implies a substantial and often underestimated OT footprint. This includes a large number of Building Management Systems, HVAC controls, physical access control systems, and surveillance networks. These systems are increasingly connected, either directly or indirectly, to IP networks, creating a significant attack surface. A disruption or compromise in these OT environments could have severe consequences, including impacting tenant operations (a primary revenue source), jeopardizing public safety, causing physical damage to historic assets, or interrupting essential Port services. This underscores the relevance of specialized OT security expertise beyond traditional cargo-handling systems.


Digital transformation initiatives:The Port is actively pursuing digital transformation, as evidenced by its strategic plan's goals of "Evolution" (evolving the waterfront to respond to changing needs) and "Engagement" (enhancing digital outreach).8 Specific projects identified include the replacement of the asset management system, development of a lease pipeline system, and upgrades to its GIS capabilities.8 The central role of the new IS Director is to develop a "strategic systems plan" and spearhead "major system replacements or upgrades," indicating a clear commitment to modernizing its technological capabilities.14 The Port has also recently revamped its website and is focused on improving digital communications and engagement strategies.7


Infrastructure challenges:The most significant publicly acknowledged infrastructure challenge is the existence of "numerous, unintegrated, and under-supported systems" 14, indicative of considerable technical debt. The advanced age of many Port facilities 19 likely extends to some of the supporting IT and OT infrastructure, potentially leading to compatibility issues, difficulties in patching, and increased vulnerability. The Port also faces a "significant deferred maintenance backlog" and operates under a "constrained capital budget" for physical facilities 44, a financial reality that could similarly impact the refresh cycles and modernization pace of its technology infrastructure.

This table highlights key technology projects that the Port has prioritized. Each of these initiatives presents an opportunity for NCC Group to engage by offering specialized cybersecurity services to ensure these modernizations are implemented securely, thereby protecting the Port's investment and mitigating associated risks.2. Security Posture and History

Security incident history:Based on the publicly available information reviewed, there are no documented major security breaches or publicly disclosed significant security incidents specifically attributed to the Port of San Francisco. While this is a positive indicator, it does not definitively mean that no incidents have occurred; any past events may not have met the thresholds for public disclosure or regulatory reporting. This lack of public information constitutes an information gap regarding a confirmed history of security incidents.


Current security program elements:The Port's cybersecurity program is intrinsically linked to the overarching framework established by the City and County of San Francisco.

Security frameworks in use: The CCSF Cybersecurity Policy explicitly recommends the adoption of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as a methodology for securing information resources.42 It is highly probable that the Port, as a city department, aligns its cybersecurity efforts with this framework.
Published security policies or standards: The CCSF Citywide Cybersecurity Policy 42 applies to all city departments, including the Port. This policy mandates several actions, such as the appointment of a Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO), adoption of a cybersecurity framework, support for unified cyber incident response, annual departmental cybersecurity risk assessments, and development of department-specific cybersecurity requirements that are equivalent to or greater than citywide standards. The Port would be expected to have its own departmental elaborations of these citywide policies.
Compliance status with relevant regulations: The Port's diverse operations necessitate compliance with various regulations. These likely include:

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): If the Port directly processes credit card payments for services like leasing, parking, or event fees, or if its tenants do so using Port-provided network infrastructure.
Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA): For its maritime facilities, particularly cruise and cargo terminals.
Data privacy laws: Such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), concerning the handling of personal information of California residents (e.g., tenants, employees, potentially cruise passengers).
The specific compliance status with these regulations is not detailed in the public information.


Security team structure: A large, dedicated internal security team is not apparent from the available information. The Port likely relies on its appointed DISO (who needs to be identified), potentially the Security and Emergency Planning Manager 21 for aspects of physical and operational security with cyber implications, and the IT staff operating under the direction of the (future) IS Director. The CCSF Office of Cybersecurity 40 provides city-wide support, guidance, and potentially centralized security services or incident response capabilities that the Port can leverage.



Security investments and initiatives:The Security and Emergency Planning Manager is responsible for a budget allocated to emergency preparedness training, planning, and Port security projects.21 At the city level, there is a stated focus by the CCSF CIO to "ramp up" cybersecurity and IT infrastructure capabilities.41 Specific budget allocations or major security initiatives solely for the Port are not detailed, but investments are being made within the broader context of city and Port operations.


Vulnerability profile:No specific public vulnerability disclosures pertaining directly to the Port of San Francisco were found. However, general cybersecurity awareness is indicated by CCSF training programs that cover common attack vectors such as port scans, buffer overflow exploits, SQL injection, and Trojans.65 Given its operational profile, the Port would be susceptible to standard web application vulnerabilities, network misconfigurations, and system vulnerabilities common to many organizations. The historic nature of some of its facilities might also imply the presence of older, potentially less secure OT systems that could be vulnerable if not properly isolated or updated.

3. Current Vendor Relationships

Security vendor ecosystem:Specific security vendors currently engaged by the Port of San Francisco are not detailed in the provided public information. The CCSF Department of Technology, which has an annual operating budget of $140 million and over 260 employees, manages city-wide data centers, telecommunications, and cybersecurity services.41 It is probable that CCSF has established city-wide master agreements or preferred vendor relationships for common security technologies and services (e.g., endpoint protection, firewalls, email security), which the Port might leverage or be required to use. Identifying the Port's current security service providers and technology vendors for key functions like endpoint security, network security, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and vulnerability management is a key task for any prospective security partner. This represents a significant information gap.


Contract information (if public):Publicly available details regarding specific security contract values or renewal dates for the Port are not present in the reviewed materials. As a department of the City and County of San Francisco, the Port's procurement processes for significant technology and security services will adhere to CCSF's official procurement regulations and procedures. These processes in the public sector are typically characterized by formal solicitations (e.g., Requests for Proposals - RFPs), specific requirements that may include preferences for local businesses or adherence to other city policies, and a structured evaluation and award cycle. The mention of "Chapter 6 contracting regulations" 44 in Port job descriptions confirms the applicability of formal city contracting rules. The CCSF Department of Technology's website also refers to a "San Francisco City Partner" portal for bidding opportunities from various city agencies.66 While relationship-building remains crucial for understanding needs and influencing requirements, formal procurement processes will govern major acquisitions. This implies that NCC Group should be prepared for such formal processes and familiarize itself with the city's procurement portal and supplier qualification requirements.

4. Technical Pain Points and Challenges

Publicly acknowledged technical issues:The most significant publicly acknowledged technical issue is the state of its current systems, described as "numerous, unintegrated, and under-supported" in the recruitment documents for the new Information Systems Director.14 This same document explicitly states the need for "major system replacements or upgrades." These are direct admissions from the Port (or at least from the leadership approving the job description) of existing technical debt and systemic inefficiencies that require strategic intervention.


Security-specific challenges:The Port's complex and diverse operational environment inherently presents numerous security challenges. These include:

Securing a sprawling and aging infrastructure that mixes historic structures with modern developments.
Protecting a wide array of public access points across its 7.5-mile jurisdiction.
Managing security for a large and varied tenant population (over 550 leases 1), each with its own IT footprint and potential impact on shared Port infrastructure or services.
Effectively securing both traditional IT systems and a diverse range of OT environments (including building management systems, pier operational technologies, and physical security systems).
Ensuring consistent compliance with CCSF cybersecurity policies and relevant industry/regulatory mandates (e.g., PCI DSS, MTSA, data privacy laws).
The management of IT and security for numerous tenants creates a significant third-party risk. Each tenant introduces their own IT systems and may connect to Port-provided services (e.g., internet connectivity, building management interfaces). This complex ecosystem can become a vector for threats into the Port's own network or shared infrastructure if network segmentation, access controls, and tenant security requirements are not rigorously managed and enforced. Effectively managing this extended attack surface is a substantial undertaking.



Industry-specific technical challenges:The Port faces technical challenges common to its specific industries:

Maritime Sector: Securing systems related to cruise terminal operations (e.g., passenger processing, baggage handling integration, vessel services), cargo logistics support systems (even for niche cargo), and ensuring compliance with maritime security regulations.
Public-Facing Services: Protecting its website, online permitting systems (like the Electronic Plan Review process 67), and any other digital services offered to the public or tenants from defacement, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks.
Critical Infrastructure: Integrating robust cybersecurity measures into physical infrastructure upgrade projects, such as the ongoing Seawall Resilience Program, to protect the control and monitoring systems that will be part of this modernized infrastructure.



Executive statements on challenges:The most direct executive-level acknowledgment of technical challenges comes implicitly through the approved job description for the Information Systems Director, which frames the role as one intended to address the problems of "unintegrated and under-supported systems" and to lead "major system replacements".14 This indicates that Port leadership is aware of the existing technical limitations and supports the strategic direction of modernization.

5. Technology Footprint Analysis

Online technical presence:The Port of San Francisco maintains a standard online presence for a public entity of its nature. This includes its official website (sfport.com 17) and engagement through various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.13 Job postings for Port positions are typically listed on the City and County of San Francisco's official careers portal (careers.sf.gov 14).


Digital asset inventory (Publicly discoverable):The primary public-facing digital asset is its main domain, sfport.com. A comprehensive inventory of subdomains would require active scanning and reconnaissance. Publicly accessible applications include the main Port website and potentially specialized portals for tenants (e.g., for lease management or service requests) or online permit systems (such as the Electronic Plan Review (EPR) process mentioned in relation to building permits 67). The attack surface likely includes these web applications, associated APIs, and any other internet-exposed services.


Technology usage patterns:Specific web technologies, frontend frameworks, backend systems, database technologies, or analytics platforms in use by the Port are not detailed in the provided public information. This would require more in-depth technical reconnaissance.


Shadow IT indicators:Given the Port's large and diverse operational landscape, with over 550 leases 1 and multiple distinct divisions, there is a considerable potential for shadow IT. Individual departments or tenants might adopt unsanctioned SaaS applications or devices, particularly if centralized IT systems are perceived as slow, inefficient, or lacking specific desired functionalities. The strategic push by the incoming IS Director to consolidate and integrate "numerous, unintegrated, and under-supported systems" 14 itself hints at a past or current proliferation of systems that may not have been under central IT governance, a common characteristic of environments where shadow IT can thrive. Addressing this potential shadow IT landscape will be a key challenge in establishing a cohesive and secure technology environment.

Security Threat Alignment

Mapping of organization's profile to likely threats:The Port of San Francisco's public profile, its role as a landlord for numerous businesses, its cruise operations, and its status as critical infrastructure make it a target for a variety of cyber threats. Ransomware attacks pose a significant risk, potentially disrupting operations, impacting revenue-generating activities (like lease management or cruise terminal functions), and leading to costly recovery efforts. Data breaches are a major concern, given the handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for cruise passengers, tenants, and employees; a breach could result in regulatory fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Attacks on public-facing web services (e.g., defacement, denial-of-service) could disrupt information dissemination and public interaction. Disruption of OT systems, including building management systems critical for tenant operations and physical security systems essential for public safety, is also a plausible threat.


Connection to threat actors (e.g., Dragos named actors if OT is industrial):While the Port is not a heavy industrial facility like those typically targeted by highly specialized ICS threat actors (such as VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, or ELECTRUM, often highlighted by Dragos in the context of electric utilities or oil and gas), its OT systems (BMS, PACS, pier operations) are still potential targets. These systems could be vulnerable to less specialized but still impactful threat actors, including general ransomware groups that are increasingly targeting OT environments, or state-influenced actors interested in disrupting critical infrastructure or conducting espionage. Awareness of the general OT threat landscape, common vulnerabilities in building controls and physical security systems, and attacker TTPs is crucial.


Industry-specific threat landscape:The Port is exposed to threats prevalent in the maritime sector, such as those targeting shipping logistics systems (though its cargo is specialized, some systems support these operations), port operational technologies, and the data-rich environment of cruise lines (passenger manifests, payment information). As a public sector entity, it also faces threats common to government organizations, including politically motivated attacks (hacktivism), espionage attempts aimed at accessing sensitive city or regional data, and financially motivated attacks seeking to exploit public funds or data.


Attack surface analysis:The Port's attack surface is extensive and diverse. It includes:

Physical: 7.5 miles of waterfront with numerous buildings, piers, and public access areas.
Network: Internal IT networks, connections to CCSF networks, internet-facing systems, and potentially networks extended to tenants.
Applications: Public website, internal business applications (finance, HR, leasing), specialized maritime applications, and potentially tenant-facing portals.
Human: Employees, contractors, tenants, and the general public interacting with Port systems or its physical environment.
OT: A wide range of building management systems, physical security controls, and operational systems for piers and cargo areas.



Likely vulnerability patterns:Common vulnerability patterns could include unpatched software and firmware in both IT and OT systems (especially if legacy systems are prevalent), misconfigured cloud services (if cloud adoption is underway without mature security practices), vulnerabilities in custom or older web applications, weak or default credentials, insufficient network segmentation between IT, OT, and tenant environments, and susceptibility to social engineering attacks targeting employees due to the public-facing nature of the organization.

NCC-Dragos Solution Alignment

"Now/Next/Never" vulnerability mapping and solution prioritization:A phased approach to addressing the Port's security needs, aligned with the "Now/Next/Never" framework, would be appropriate:

Now (Immediate Priorities):

Critical System Protection: Focus on securing core revenue-generating systems (e.g., financial systems, real estate leasing platforms) and operations with high public impact or sensitivity (e.g., cruise passenger data handling, cruise terminal operational systems). This includes comprehensive vulnerability assessments and penetration testing of these key assets.
Data Security: Implement measures to protect sensitive PII related to passengers, tenants, and employees, aligning with CCPA/CPRA and other data privacy mandates.
OT Resilience (Foundational): Ensure the resilience of essential building management OT systems (HVAC, power in critical facilities) and public safety systems (emergency communications, core physical security controls).
Addressing Known Issues: Strategize the secure decommissioning or remediation of systems acknowledged as "unintegrated and under-supported."
DISO Support: Provide interim or advisory support to the Port's DISO to help implement CCSF policies and conduct initial risk assessments.


Next (Strategic Enhancements):

Comprehensive OT Security Program: Conduct a thorough OT security assessment across the Port's diverse facility portfolio (BMS, PACS, pier operations, etc.) and develop a long-term OT security roadmap. This could involve deploying OT-specific visibility and monitoring solutions like the Dragos Platform for relevant environments.
Security for Modernization: Integrate security into all ongoing and planned system modernization projects from the design phase (secure SDLC consulting, architecture reviews, pre-deployment testing).
Advanced Threat Detection & Response: Implement or enhance Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities, potentially coupled with Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services for both IT and OT environments.
Integrated Incident Response: Develop and test a comprehensive incident response plan that covers both IT and OT scenarios and integrates with CCSF's unified command structure.
Supply Chain / Tenant Risk Management: Develop a program to assess and manage cybersecurity risks introduced by third-party vendors and tenants.


Never (Risk Acceptance - with caveats):

Certain truly isolated, low-impact legacy systems where the cost of upgrade or replacement is prohibitive might be candidates for risk acceptance. However, this should only occur after a thorough risk assessment confirms their low impact and lack of connectivity, and if compensating controls (e.g., stringent physical isolation, monitoring) are implemented and regularly verified.





Specific solution recommendations:Based on the Port's profile, NCC Group and Dragos can offer a suite of solutions:

Advisory Services: Comprehensive Security Risk Assessments (covering IT, OT, and physical security interfaces), GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) consulting to align with NIST CSF, PCI DSS, MTSA, and data privacy laws, vCISO or DISO augmentation services, secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) consulting for new application development or system integration projects.
Technical Assurance Services: Penetration testing (network infrastructure, web applications, mobile applications, OT systems), red teaming exercises to simulate real-world attacks, vulnerability assessments.
Managed Services: Managed Detection and Response (MDR) for IT environments, and specialized OT network monitoring and threat detection (leveraging the Dragos Platform and expertise) for critical OT assets.
Incident Response: Provision of an Incident Response retainer for rapid support in the event of a security breach, digital forensics services, and tabletop exercises to test IR plans.
Cloud Security: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) services and cloud security architecture reviews if the Port expands its cloud footprint.

Assist in meeting compliance obligations under CCSF policies and industry-specific regulations.



Unique differentiation against current vendors:The key differentiator lies in the combined and deeply specialized expertise in both enterprise IT cybersecurity (NCC Group) and industrial/OT cybersecurity (Dragos). This holistic view is particularly valuable for an entity like the Port with significant convergence between these domains. Additional differentiators include deep understanding of critical infrastructure security challenges, sector-specific knowledge (maritime, public sector), actionable threat intelligence, and the ability to provide end-to-end services from strategic advisory through technical testing to incident response and managed monitoring.


Implementation approach based on technical realities:A successful implementation approach must be phased and acknowledge the Port's operational realities:

Begin with foundational assessments to establish a clear baseline of the current IT and OT security posture and identify the most critical risks.
Prioritize quick wins and solutions that address immediate pain points or support ongoing high-priority modernization projects.
Recognize the potential presence of legacy systems and develop strategies that allow for secure integration or phased replacement, rather than assuming a "rip and replace" approach for all systems.
Collaborate closely with the new IS Director and the Port's DISO to ensure alignment with their strategic plans and CCSF requirements.
Emphasize knowledge transfer and capacity building to support the Port's internal team.


GTM Analysis Part 3: Strategic Sales Approach & Battle CardTARGET ORGANIZATION: Port of San FranciscoExecutive SummaryThe strategic sales approach for engaging the Port of San Francisco should center on aligning NCC Group-Dragos's comprehensive cybersecurity solutions with the Port's explicitly stated strategic initiatives: Resilience, Economic Recovery and Growth, Equity, Sustainability, and the Evolution of its waterfront.8 The engagement should emphasize a partnership model, focusing on long-term value creation and risk reduction tailored to the Port's unique operational blend of maritime activities, extensive real estate management, and public-facing services.Given the Port's role as critical infrastructure, its ongoing system modernization efforts 14, and its public visibility, it represents a high-priority target. The engagement timeline is expected to be multi-stage, commencing with initial discovery and relationship-building with the new Information Systems (IS) Director (once appointed) and existing financial leadership, potentially leading to broader strategic discussions with the executive team and the Port Commission for significant undertakings.Key stakeholders for targeting include the Chief Financial Officer (Nate Cruz), the incoming IS Director, the Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO), the Security & Emergency Planning Manager, the Chief Operating Officer (Michael Martin), and the Executive Director (Elaine Forbes).

Current security and compliance projects:Security and compliance are integral to the Port's operations and strategic planning.

Waterfront Resilience Program: This major, multi-year initiative is primarily focused on addressing seismic and flood risks along the Embarcadero and other waterfront areas.7 While physical resilience is the main driver, the program inherently involves protecting critical infrastructure and the systems that will monitor and manage these new defenses, implying a need for operational and cyber resilience as well.
Adherence to CCSF Cybersecurity Policy: As a department of the City and County of San Francisco, the Port is mandated to comply with the CCSF Cybersecurity Policy. This includes adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a basis for its program and appointing a Departmental Information Security Officer (DISO).42
Regulatory Compliance: The Port likely has ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with various industry-specific regulations, such as PCI DSS for payment processing related to cruise operations or tenant leases, the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) for its port facilities, and data privacy laws like CCPA/CPRA.
Physical Security Upgrades: As part of its broader capital improvement programs, the Port likely undertakes periodic upgrades to its physical security systems (e.g., CCTV, access control), which increasingly have networked components requiring cybersecurity considerations.



Budget cycles and financial planning:Understanding the Port's financial cadence is crucial for timing sales engagements.

Fiscal Year Schedule: The Port's fiscal year runs from July 1st to June 30th.6
Budget Approval Timelines: The Port typically operates on a biennial operating and capital budget cycle (e.g., FY2022-23 & FY2023-24 budget book 45; FY2024-25 & FY2025-26 budget mentioned 24). The overall budget requires approval from the Port Commission.
Capital Expenditure Patterns: The Port has significant ongoing capital needs, particularly for infrastructure maintenance and resilience projects. Funding for these expenditures comes from a mix of Port-generated revenue, grants from federal and state sources, and bond issuances.24 The Port maintains a 10-Year Capital Plan to guide these long-term investments.24
Quarterly Financial Priorities: While not explicitly detailed, quarterly priorities would likely align with progress against the biennial budget, performance of revenue-generating divisions (real estate, maritime), and milestones for major capital projects.



Industry-specific priorities:The Port's priorities are shaped by trends and requirements within its key operating sectors.

Public Sector Real Estate & Tourism: Focus on sustainable development practices, enhancing public access and amenities, preserving historic structures, ensuring tenant satisfaction, and maintaining the safety and attractiveness of its popular tourist destinations.


2. OT Environment AnalysisThe Port of San Francisco's Operational Technology (OT) environment is diverse, reflecting its multifaceted roles as a maritime operator, an extensive real estate manager, and a provider of public spaces and services. While not a heavy industrial entity in the traditional sense, its reliance on various control systems for facility operation and safety is significant.

Industrial systems landscape:The Port's OT systems are primarily concentrated in:

Building Management Systems (BMS) / Building Automation Systems (BAS): Essential for controlling HVAC, lighting, power, and other environmental systems across its numerous commercial, retail, office, and historic properties, including the Ferry Building and tenanted piers.1
Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) and CCTV Surveillance: Deployed extensively across the 7.5 miles of waterfront, covering public areas, tenant leaseholds, cruise terminals, and cargo facilities to ensure security and public safety.
Pier Operations Support Systems: These include systems for managing shore power for cruise ships, lighting for piers and public areas, and potentially monitoring systems for pier structures.
Cargo Handling Equipment: Specialized cranes (Paceco, Hyundai/Paceco) at cargo piers like Pier 80 and Piers 94/96 have their own embedded control systems.5
Public Utility Distribution and Monitoring: Systems for managing the distribution and monitoring of utilities (water, electricity) across Port properties.



OT security maturity:The security maturity of the Port's OT environment is likely developing and may vary significantly across different facilities, particularly given the mix of historic structures and more modern developments. The CCSF cybersecurity framework 42 provides a baseline, but dedicated OT security practices may be less mature than those for traditional IT systems. The mandate for the new Information Systems Director to create a comprehensive strategic systems plan 14 presents an opportunity to formally integrate OT security into this broader strategy. Historically, OT systems in many organizations, including public entities, have been managed separately from IT, often by engineering or facilities departments, which can lead to gaps in security governance and technical controls.


OT threat exposure:The Port's OT systems are exposed to a range of threats that could have significant operational, financial, and safety impacts:

Disruption of Building Services: A compromise of BMS could disrupt HVAC, power, or lighting, impacting tenant operations, damaging sensitive equipment, or creating unsafe conditions in public areas. This could lead to revenue loss from tenant dissatisfaction or operational downtime.
Compromise of Physical Security Systems: Manipulation of PACS or CCTV systems could undermine physical security, allowing unauthorized access, facilitating theft or vandalism, or hampering incident response and public safety efforts.
Interference with Pier Operations: Attacks on systems controlling shore power could affect cruise ship turnaround or cargo handling support.
Ransomware: Ransomware attacks increasingly target OT environments, potentially locking up control systems and demanding payment for restoration.
While highly specialized ICS threat actors like VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, or ELECTRUM (often associated with the energy sector) may be less of a direct concern, the Port's OT assets are still susceptible to broader threat actors targeting critical infrastructure or exploiting common vulnerabilities in unpatched or misconfigured OT devices and networks.



OT security initiatives:Specific, publicly announced OT security initiatives for the Port are not detailed. However, the overarching Waterfront Resilience Program 7, while focused on physical threats like earthquakes and sea level rise, should ideally incorporate considerations for the resilience of the OT systems that will manage and monitor the upgraded infrastructure. The system modernization efforts to be led by the new IS Director 14 may also encompass some OT systems, particularly those with network connectivity or data interfaces with enterprise IT systems.
The Port's diverse operations create a complex, interconnected IT/OT environment. The recruitment of a new IS Director tasked with developing a strategic systems plan 14 signifies a critical juncture. This presents an opportune moment for NCC Group-Dragos to advocate for the integration of OT security into the broader cybersecurity strategy from the outset. The "unintegrated systems" referenced in the IS Director's mandate 14 likely include numerous OT assets that may currently lack adequate security oversight. By addressing both IT and OT security holistically, NCC Group-Dragos can help the new IS Director develop a converged security roadmap, ensuring that as systems are modernized and integrated, security is a foundational element, directly supporting the Port's overarching resilience goals.8

3. Value Proposition AlignmentAligning NCC Group-Dragos's capabilities with the Port of San Francisco's strategic objectives and addressing its specific pain points is key to a successful engagement.

What are the Port's biggest perceived cybersecurity concerns related to its diverse operations (cruise, real estate, cargo, public venues)?
How does the CCSF cybersecurity policy impact the Port's autonomy in selecting and implementing security solutions? What is the relationship with the city's central IT/security teams?
How is cybersecurity managed for the Port's extensive tenant ecosystem? Are there shared security responsibilities or minimum requirements for tenants?
What is the current inventory and age profile of key OT systems (BMS, PACS, pier controls)? Are there known vulnerabilities or concerns?
What are the primary drivers for current and future security investments (e.g., compliance, risk reduction, enabling new initiatives)?
Are there any specific upcoming projects or RFPs related to cybersecurity or system upgrades where external expertise is being sought?


Technical Assessment Approach: Propose a phased assessment, potentially starting with a high-level risk overview or focusing on a specific critical area identified during initial discussions.
Business Impact Discovery: Understand how different cyber scenarios could impact the Port's revenue, operations, reputation, and ability to meet its public service mandate.
Need Verification Process: Validate assumptions and align proposed solutions directly with the Port's acknowledged pain points and strategic goals.
Current State Analysis Methodology: Employ a combination of workshops, interviews with key personnel, documentation review, and (if permitted) non-intrusive technical reconnaissance.



Sales process flow:Engaging with a public agency like the Port typically involves a more structured and potentially longer sales cycle.

Expected Sales Cycle Length: Can range from several months to over a year, depending on the scale of the proposed solution and alignment with budget cycles.
Decision Stages and Milestones: Initial contact and discovery -> Needs analysis and solution framing -> Technical validation/POC (if applicable) -> Proposal development -> Internal Port reviews (IT, Finance, Legal, Executive) -> Formal procurement process (RFP/RFQ if required by CCSF rules) -> Port Commission approval (for major contracts) -> Contract negotiation and award.
Approval Requirements: Approvals will be needed from various levels, including the IS Director, CFO, potentially COO and Executive Director, and ultimately the Port Commission for significant expenditures. Adherence to CCSF procurement rules (e.g., Chapter 6 contracting regulations 44) is mandatory.
Contract Process: Will follow CCSF legal and contracting procedures.
Procurement Procedures: Familiarity with CCSF's procurement portal and vendor registration requirements will be necessary.



Objection handling:Anticipate and prepare for common objections (detailed further in the Battle Card section). These may include concerns about budget, perceived adequacy of current (possibly city-provided) security, the complexity of new solutions, or timing conflicts with other initiatives. Responses should be evidence-based, focusing on ROI, risk reduction, and alignment with the Port's strategic priorities.

5. Implementation and Success PlanningA well-defined implementation and success plan will be crucial for building a long-term partnership with the Port of San Francisco.

Implementation methodology:

Phased Deployment Approach: Implement solutions in phases, aligned with the "Now/Next/Never" prioritization. Start with foundational assessments, address critical risks, and then move to broader strategic enhancements. This allows for demonstrating value early and adapting to the Port's evolving needs and budget availability.
Resource Requirements: Clearly define the resources required from both NCC Group-Dragos and the Port for each phase (personnel, access, information).
Timeline and Milestones: Develop a realistic project timeline with clear, measurable milestones for each phase of implementation.
Success Criteria: Collaboratively define clear, quantifiable success criteria for each engagement component, tied to the Port's objectives (e.g., reduction in critical vulnerabilities, improved incident detection times, successful secure deployment of a new system).
Change Management Approach: Work with Port leadership to manage any organizational changes associated with new security processes or technologies, ensuring buy-in and smooth adoption by Port staff.



Strategic expansion opportunities:The initial engagement can serve as a foundation for a broader strategic partnership.

Initial Engagement to Full Deployment: An initial assessment or a focused project (e.g., securing a specific modernization initiative) can lead to a more comprehensive, long-term security program.
Cross-sell Opportunities: As trust and understanding grow, introduce complementary services from the NCC Group-Dragos portfolio (e.g., moving from advisory to managed services, or from IT security to a dedicated OT security program).
Solution Expansion Paths: For example, an initial OT visibility deployment could expand to include active monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response for the OT environment.
Long-term Relationship Development: Position NCC Group-Dragos as a trusted, long-term cybersecurity advisor and partner, providing ongoing support, threat intelligence updates, and strategic guidance as the Port's needs evolve.
Enterprise-wide Security Maturity: Work with the Port to progressively enhance its overall cybersecurity maturity across all divisions and operational areas.



Proof of concept (POC) strategy:A POC can be a valuable tool for demonstrating capabilities and building confidence, particularly for more advanced or complex solutions.

POC Scope Recommendations: Scope the POC on a specific, well-defined critical system or a representative segment of the Port's environment where value can be clearly demonstrated (e.g., monitoring a key BMS network, conducting a penetration test on a new application before launch, a limited deployment of the Dragos Platform on a critical OT asset).
Success Metrics for POC: Define clear, measurable success metrics for the POC in advance (e.g., number of critical threats detected, time to identify anomalous behavior, ease of use for Port staff).
POC to Production Transition: Outline a clear path for transitioning from a successful POC to a full production deployment.
POC Timeline and Resource Needs: Define a realistic timeline (e.g., 30-90 days) and clearly state the resource commitments required from both the Port and NCC Group-Dragos.
POC Stakeholder Management: Ensure key Port stakeholders (e.g., IS Director, DISO, relevant operational managers) are involved in the POC definition, execution, and review of results.



Long-term success measurement:Demonstrating ongoing value is key to a lasting partnership.

Ongoing Value Demonstration: Provide regular reporting on security posture, threats mitigated, and services delivered. Conduct periodic strategic reviews (e.g., Quarterly Business Reviews - QBRs) to ensure alignment with the Port's evolving objectives.
Security Improvement Metrics: Track and report on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as reduction in mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to incidents, decrease in the number of critical vulnerabilities, and improvements in security assessment scores.
Business Impact Reporting: Where possible, quantify the business impact of security improvements, such as avoided losses from prevented incidents or efficiency gains from more secure and reliable systems.
Executive Dashboard Recommendations: Offer to help develop or provide input for an executive-level dashboard that clearly communicates the Port's cybersecurity posture, key risks, and the value of security investments to the Port Commission and senior leadership.
Client Success Timeline: Develop a shared timeline that maps out key milestones for achieving long-term security maturity and resilience goals in partnership with the Port.
