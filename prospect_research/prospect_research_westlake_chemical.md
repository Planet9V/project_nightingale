NCC Group Pursuit Strategy: Westlake Chemical Corporation
GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Westlake Chemical Corporation
Executive Summary
Westlake Corporation, having recently transitioned from its former identity as Westlake Chemical Corporation, presents a dynamic and evolving profile for engagement. This shift in name, effective February 2022, is indicative of a broader strategic diversification, moving beyond its traditional chemical strongholds into the housing and infrastructure product sectors, largely propelled by a series of significant acquisitions.1 This expansion, while opening new revenue streams, inherently introduces operational complexities and an expanded, more varied cyber-attack surface, particularly concerning Operational Technology (OT) in newly integrated manufacturing facilities.
The company, founded in 1986 and headquartered in Houston, Texas, operates an extensive global network of manufacturing sites and offices.2 Its leadership, characterized by the long-standing presence of the Chao family, provides deep institutional knowledge, now complemented by the external perspective of a relatively new CEO, Jean-Marc Gilson, appointed in July 2024.4 This blend of continuity and new leadership may foster an environment receptive to strategic initiatives, including enhancements to cybersecurity posture, especially given the CEO's experience with large, global operations.
Financially, Westlake demonstrates significant scale, though recent figures suggest market headwinds or cyclical impacts.6 The company's aggressive merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy, culminating in major purchases between 2016 and 2022, points towards likely IT and OT integration challenges. Such "integration debt" often manifests as heterogeneous systems, inconsistent security policies, and potential legacy vulnerabilities, creating opportunities for specialized assessment and security services.
Westlake's competitive positioning as a low-cost, vertically integrated manufacturer is underpinned by core values emphasizing Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), Quality, and Competitiveness.2 The pronounced HSE focus offers a strategic alignment for discussing OT cybersecurity, as the integrity of industrial control systems is intrinsically linked to physical safety and environmental protection in chemical manufacturing. The presence of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) since 2017, Tim W. Smith, and a dedicated OT Cybersecurity Administrator within his team, signals a recognized concern for industrial cybersecurity, providing a direct avenue for engagement.8
Organizational Profile
Full legal name and corporate structure
The full legal name of the organization is Westlake Corporation. It officially changed its name from Westlake Chemical Corporation on February 18, 2022.1 This name change was a strategic decision reflecting the company's increasingly diversified business portfolio, which has expanded significantly through recent acquisitions and organic growth.1
Westlake Corporation is now organized under a unified brand with two primary financial reporting segments 1:
Housing & Infrastructure Products: This segment includes Westlake Royal Building Products, Westlake Pipe & Fittings, Westlake Global Compounds, and Westlake Dimex.
Performance & Essential Materials: This segment comprises Westlake North American Vinyls, Westlake North American Chlor-alkali & Derivatives, Westlake European & Asian Chlorovinyls, Westlake Olefins, Westlake Polyethylene, and Westlake Epoxy. These two segments replaced the company's former Olefins and Vinyls segments.1
Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
Westlake Corporation was founded in 1986 by T.T. Chao, a notable figure in the global petrochemical industry, along with his sons Albert Y. Chao and James Y. Chao.2 The company's global headquarters is located at 2801 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77056, USA.2
Westlake operates on a global scale, with a significant manufacturing and operational presence. It maintains approximately 36 locations in North America, 11 locations in Europe, and 6 locations in Asia.3 These facilities underscore a complex, distributed operational network requiring robust logistical and technological support. A detailed list of these international locations, including plants in Calvert City, Kentucky, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, which are central to its ethylene production, can be found on the company's website.7
Organizational history and key milestones
Westlake's journey began with the acquisition of a polyethylene plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in 1986.11 Building on prior experience in Asia, the company pursued a strategy of consistent growth through further acquisitions, expansion of existing facilities, and new construction.3
Key milestones include:
1980s: Startup of a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plant in Lake Charles, LA (1986) and subsequent LDPE capacity expansions.11
1990s: Acquisition of a Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) plant (1990) and a PVC plant (1991) in Calvert City, KY. Startup of an Ethylene plant (1991) and a Styrene Monomer plant (1992) in Lake Charles, LA. Expansion into China with Suzhou Huasu Plastics (1992) and a PVC resin plant JV in Suzhou (1999). Acquisition of Chlor-Alkali & Olefins plants in Calvert City, KY (1997).14
2000s: Acquisition of PVC and VCM plants in Geismar, LA (2002). Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the NYSE (WLK) in 2004. Acquisition of Eastman's Polyethylene Business in Longview, TX (2006).14
2010s: Acquisition of CertainTeed's PVC Pipe business (2013). Formation of Westlake Chemical Partners (2014). Acquisition of Vinnolit Holdings GmbH (2014). Named a "Forbes Top 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America" (2015). Acquisition of Axiall Corporation (2016). Listed as a "Fortune 500" company (2018). Acquisition of Nakan (global compounding) and DaVinci Roofscapes (2019).14
2020s: Acquisitions of LASCO Fittings, Dimex LLC, and Boral Limited's North American building products businesses (2021). Acquisition of Hexion Inc.â€™s global epoxy business (2022). Name change to Westlake Corporation and reorganization into new segments (2022).1
Industry classification and primary business activities
Westlake Corporation is a global manufacturer and supplier of petrochemicals, vinyls, polymers, and fabricated building products.2 These products are fundamental to a wide variety of consumer and industrial markets, including food packaging, automotive products, coatings, pipes, and residential construction materials.1
The company's North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is primarily listed as 325211 for Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing.12 An alternative NAICS code provided is 326113 for Unlaminated Plastics Film and Sheet (except Packaging) Manufacturing.15 Its Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is primarily 28210207 for Polyethylene resins 12, with an alternative SIC code of 2819 for Industrial Inorganic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.15 The presence of multiple NAICS and SIC codes reflects Westlake's evolution and the breadth of its operations. While its core remains in plastics and resin manufacturing, the additional classifications point to a wider scope of industrial chemical manufacturing. This diversity suggests a variety of production environments, from basic chemical synthesis to materials processing and fabrication, each potentially utilizing distinct Operational Technology (OT) with unique security considerations.

Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
Westlake Corporation's global operations span North America, Europe, and Asia. The company's website provides an extensive list of its manufacturing plants and offices.13
North America: Numerous facilities across the United States (including major complexes in Louisiana and Kentucky), Canada (Abbotsford, BC; Beauharnois, QC; Concord, ON), and Mexico (Matamoros, Tijuana).
Europe: Operations in France (La Ciotat, Reims), Spain (Barbastro, Santa PerpÃ¨tua de Mogoda), Germany (Burghausen, Cologne, Duisburg, etc.), Belgium (Louvain La Neuve), the Netherlands (Pernis, Rotterdam), and Italy (Samarate).
Asia: Facilities in China (Changshu, Suzhou, Taicang), Japan (Saitama, Tokyo), South Korea (Onsan, Seoul), Taiwan (Kaohsiung), and Vietnam (Dong Nai Province, Bien Hoa). The sheer number and global distribution of these sites highlight a complex logistical network and a correspondingly intricate IT and OT infrastructure.
Detailed corporate structure
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: Westlake Corporation serves as the ultimate parent company. A key entity within its structure is Westlake Chemical Partners LP (NYSE: WLKP), a publicly traded limited partnership formed by Westlake Corporation. WLKP's purpose is to operate, acquire, and develop ethylene production facilities and other qualified assets.7 The business and operations of WLKP are conducted through OpCo, a partnership between Westlake Corporation and Westlake Chemical Partners.7 An SEC filing from 2005 lists numerous historical subsidiaries such as Westlake Olefins Corporation and North American Pipe Corporation 18; however, this list predates significant M&A activity and the 2022 restructuring. More recent subsidiary information from GlobalData includes entities like Axiall Taiwan Ltd. and Westlake Compounds LLC.19
Business Units and Divisions: As noted, the company restructured in February 2022 into two main reporting segments: Housing & Infrastructure Products and Performance & Essential Materials.1 These segments now encompass the various product lines and acquired businesses.
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: The most significant recent initiative was the February 2022 name change from Westlake Chemical Corporation to Westlake Corporation and the simultaneous reorganization into the two new business segments.1 This was explicitly done to reflect the company's more diversified business portfolio resulting from acquisitions and strategic growth, particularly in the housing and infrastructure sectors.
Merger and Acquisition History: Westlake has a history of strategic acquisitions to drive growth and diversification. The period between 2016 and 2022 was particularly active, with several large-scale acquisitions that have reshaped the company. This rapid pace of M&A strongly suggests that Westlake is likely contending with substantial IT and OT integration complexities. Each acquired entity would have possessed its own IT infrastructure, cybersecurity tools, operational technologies, and internal policies. Melding these disparate systems into a secure and cohesive whole is a significant, often multi-year, undertaking. During such integration phases, the primary focus is frequently on maintaining operational continuity and achieving financial synergies, which can sometimes lead to cybersecurity integration efforts lagging. This period of transformation and system amalgamation can inadvertently create security gaps or leave legacy vulnerabilities unaddressed, potentially expanding the attack surface.
The following table highlights key acquisitions that have shaped Westlake's current structure and capabilities.

WallStreetZen data indicates that James Chao, Albert Chao, and other family members or related entities (such as Ttwf LP and Ttwfgp LLC, which are significant holders in the related Westlake Chemical Partners LP entity) hold substantial percentages of shares.21 This insider ownership underscores a strong family influence on the company's strategic direction. Among institutional investors, Victory Capital Management Inc. is listed as a significant holder of WLK stock.22
Private Equity Ownership Details: Not applicable, as Westlake Corporation is a publicly traded entity.
Recent Ownership Changes: Reports indicate a pattern of insider selling by some executives and directors in early 2025.22 However, the Chao family continues to maintain substantial control over the company.
Leadership Analysis
Executive Leadership Team
Westlake Corporation's executive leadership team combines long-tenured members, predominantly from the founding Chao family, with newer executives who bring diverse industry experience. This blend suggests a leadership dynamic that respects foundational principles while potentially embracing new strategic directions. The long service of several key figures, particularly through the recent period of intense M&A activity, implies deep institutional knowledge and experience in managing complex integrations. The arrival of a new President and CEO in mid-2024, Jean-Marc Gilson, who has a background leading other major international chemical and materials companies, may signal an increased openness to technology modernization and a fresh evaluation of the company's operational and cybersecurity posture, especially given his experience with global complexities.

Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of Westlake Corporation is composed of individuals with strong ties to the company's founding family and experienced external executives. This composition suggests a governance model that balances long-term family strategic interests with independent oversight. The significant stock ownership by the Chao family means Westlake operates as a "controlled company" under NYSE rules, which provides exemptions from certain board independence requirements for committees like Nominating and Compensation.41 Nevertheless, the inclusion of independent directors with backgrounds as former CEOs and CFOs of other large corporations (e.g., Michael J. Graff from American Air Liquide, Kimberly S. Lubel from CST Brands, Jeffrey W. Sheets from ConocoPhillips) is vital for robust governance and introducing diverse perspectives on risk management, including cybersecurity.23 Engagement strategies should consider this dynamic, appealing to the long-term value preservation important to family-aligned directors, while addressing the risk mitigation and compliance concerns that are typically priorities for independent directors, especially those on Audit or Risk committees.
The most current and detailed information regarding board members, their profiles, committee assignments, and independence status is found in the company's annual Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) filed with the SEC. The 2025 Proxy Statement (filed March 2025) 42 is the primary source for this information.
Board Members 23:
James Y. Chao (Senior Chairman)
Albert Y. Chao (Executive Chairman, Class III Director Nominee 2025)

Committee Assignments: The 2021 Proxy Statement mentioned specific retainers for the Audit Committee chairman and Compensation Committee chairman, indicating the activity of these committees.45 The latest Proxy Statement (DEF 14A for 2025) should be consulted for current committee memberships (Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and any Risk or Environmental, Safety, and Health committees).
Director Independence: The Board makes independence determinations based on NYSE rules. The 2025 Proxy Statement notes that the Board considered Mr. Graff's former executive role at a company with which Westlake does business, though this did not preclude his independence.41 Due to family control, some independence requirements for committees are exempted.41
Areas of Expertise: The board collectively possesses expertise in the chemical industry, finance, executive leadership, M&A, international business, and corporate governance, drawn from their varied careers.
IT and Security Leadership
Westlake's IT and security leadership structure appears to be centralized under a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), with specific roles indicating attention to both traditional IT security and the increasingly critical area of Operational Technology (OT) security.
Chief Information Officer (CIO): A dedicated enterprise-wide CIO is not explicitly identified in the primary executive leadership lists.23 Robert F. Buesinger previously held the title of "Executive Vice President, Housing and Infrastructure Products, IT and Digital," suggesting that IT and digital strategy for that segment reported to him at that time.30 The absence of a clearly named overall CIO is an information gap that may indicate a federated IT leadership model or that the new CEO is still shaping this structure.
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Tim W. Smith has served as CISO since 2017.8
Educational Background: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston.9
Certifications: Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) since August 2011.9
Career History & Tenure: Joined Westlake as CISO in 2017. His tenure covers the period of significant M&A activity, meaning he has direct experience with the security challenges of integrating acquired entities.
Previous Organizations: Head of Information Security at WorleyParsons; Founder, CEO, and Principal Consultant at EnterNet Security, LLC; various IT security management roles at Huntsman, Chevron, El Paso Corporation; Manager of eRisk Solutions at Ernst & Young.8
Areas of Expertise: Information security leadership, managed security services, eRisk consulting.
Chief Technology Officer (CTO): No specific corporate CTO for Westlake Corporation is identified in the provided materials. References to CTOs in snippets 47 pertain to unrelated entities like "Westlake Financial Services" or "Westinghouse Outdoor Power Equipment."
Security Operations Leadership: This function falls under CISO Tim W. Smith. His team includes 8:
Anand Chirayath: Sr. Director - Information Systems Technical Solutions.
Stephen Wilson: Principal Analyst - IT Compliance.
Trigg Gayle: Senior Specialist - Process Control (OT Cybersecurity Admin). The existence of this role is a strong indicator that OT security is a recognized area of focus and concern within Westlake, providing a direct point of relevance for OT-specific cybersecurity services.
Compliance and Risk Management Leadership: L. Benjamin Ederington, in his various General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer roles, would have significant oversight of legal, compliance, and potentially broader enterprise risk management functions.31 Within the CISO's team, Stephen Wilson, Principal Analyst - IT Compliance, directly addresses IT compliance matters.8
Digital Transformation Leadership: While Robert F. Buesinger's former title included "IT and Digital," indicating his past leadership in this area for a segment 30, the current enterprise-wide lead for digital transformation is not explicitly stated. This may be a strategic priority for the new CEO, Jean-Marc Gilson, or fall under the revamped segment leadership.
The CISO, Tim W. Smith, having been in his role since 2017, has navigated the company through its most intensive period of acquisitions. This experience makes him a knowledgeable stakeholder regarding the complexities of integrating disparate security environments. The specific designation of an "OT Cybersecurity Admin" (Trigg Gayle) on his team is particularly noteworthy. It signals an internal acknowledgment of the unique challenges and importance of securing industrial control systems, which are prevalent across Westlake's extensive manufacturing operations. This dedicated OT role represents a key internal contact point and validates the need for specialized OT security solutions.
Middle Management in Relevant Departments
IT Infrastructure Managers: Anand Chirayath, Sr. Director - Information Systems Technical Solutions, reports to the CISO and likely oversees significant aspects of IT infrastructure.8 Further details on other IT infrastructure managers are not available in the provided information.
Security Operations Managers: These roles would typically report to the CISO, Tim W. Smith. Specific individuals are not detailed.
Network and Systems Administrators: These positions would exist within the broader IT operations structure but are not individually identified.
Procurement and Vendor Management Contacts: Specific contacts for procurement and vendor management, particularly for technology or security services, are not available in the provided information. This represents an information gap for direct outreach related to procurement processes.
Decision-Making Patterns
Organizational Decision Structures: Westlake likely employs a hybrid decision-making model. Strategic decisions, major capital allocations, and overarching policies (including for finance, legal, and core IT/security) are probably centralized at the corporate level, with significant input from the Chao family given their substantial ownership and board presence. However, operational decisions, including some technology choices specific to plant operations or business unit needs, may be more decentralized within the two major segments (Housing & Infrastructure Products and Performance & Essential Materials).
Known Approval Processes for Technology Purchases: Detailed approval processes for technology purchases are not publicly available and represent an information gap.

GTM Analysis Part 2: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Westlake Chemical Corporation
Executive Summary
Westlake Corporation's technical environment is characterized by the significant operational demands of a global chemical and building products manufacturer. The extensive merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, particularly between 2016 and 2022 1, has almost certainly resulted in a heterogeneous Operational Technology (OT) landscape, incorporating a variety of systems with differing ages and security maturity levels across its numerous manufacturing facilities.13 This diversity presents substantial challenges for centralized security oversight and creates a compelling need for specialized OT security assessment, monitoring, and governance services.
While specific details of their IT stack and security vendors are not publicly disclosed, the presence of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) since 2017, Tim W. Smith, and a dedicated OT Cybersecurity Administrator within his team 8, suggests an organizational awareness of cybersecurity imperatives, including those unique to industrial control systems. However, the sheer scale of integrating disparate IT and OT systems from acquired entities like Axiall, Boral, and Hexion likely means that unaddressed risks and legacy vulnerabilities persist. Key technical challenges will revolve around securing these diverse environments, ensuring operational resilience, protecting valuable intellectual property, and achieving consistent security posture across a global footprint. The primary security threats align with those typical for the chemical manufacturing sector: ransomware targeting both IT and OT, industrial espionage, and disruption of critical processes.
Technology Infrastructure Analysis
Detailed technology stack analysis
Publicly available information on Westlake Corporation's specific enterprise systems, cloud services, and core IT infrastructure components is limited. This is common for large manufacturing corporations that do not typically disclose such details for competitive and security reasons.
Enterprise Systems (ERP, CRM, etc.): Specific enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle) or customer relationship management (CRM) platforms (e.g., Salesforce) in use across Westlake are not identified in the provided materials. Given the scale of M&A, it is probable that multiple, potentially disparate, ERP and other business systems exist across the organization, posing integration and data harmonization challenges.
Cloud Services and Providers: Details regarding the adoption of specific cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and relationships with major cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) are not publicly available. Companies in the manufacturing sector are increasingly adopting cloud for data analytics, supply chain management, and some business applications, but the extent of Westlake's cloud footprint is an information gap.
Network Architecture: Specifics of Westlake's global network architecture are not publicly known. A company of its size and geographic distribution would operate a complex wide area network (WAN) connecting its manufacturing plants, sales offices, and headquarters.
Data Center Locations and Capabilities: Information regarding the locations and capabilities of Westlake's data centers (whether on-premises, collocated, or cloud-based) is not disclosed.
Hardware and Software Vendors: General hardware and software vendors for IT infrastructure are not specified.
Legacy Systems and Modernization Efforts: Given the age of some manufacturing facilities and the integration of numerous acquired companies, the presence of legacy IT systems is highly probable. Modernization of these systems is likely an ongoing effort, potentially accelerated under new leadership and as part of digital transformation initiatives, to improve efficiency, security, and data integration.
Operational Technology (OT) environments
Westlake's core business as a manufacturer of chemicals, polymers, and building products necessitates extensive and diverse Operational Technology (OT) environments. These systems are critical for controlling and monitoring industrial processes at their numerous plants worldwide.
Industrial Control Systems (ICS): Westlake's manufacturing processes for products such as ethylene, polyethylene, PVC, chlor-alkali, specialty chemicals, and various building materials 1 would involve a wide array of ICS. These likely include:
Distributed Control Systems (DCS): For managing complex, continuous processes in chemical plants.
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs): For discrete automation and control of machinery and specific process units.
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems: For monitoring and controlling geographically dispersed assets or large-scale processes.
SCADA Systems and Protocols: The specific SCADA systems and industrial communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, Profibus, DNP3, EtherNet/IP, OPC) in use across Westlake's varied facilities are not detailed publicly. However, a mix of legacy and modern protocols is probable due to the diverse origins and ages of their plants.
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): MES platforms are likely utilized for managing and tracking production operations on the plant floor, bridging the gap between enterprise systems (ERP) and process control systems (ICS).
Building Automation Systems (BAS): BAS would be deployed in their numerous manufacturing plants, warehouses, and office buildings to control HVAC, lighting, and physical security systems.
IoT Deployments and Connected Devices: The use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices for enhanced monitoring, predictive maintenance, and process optimization is an increasing trend in manufacturing. Westlake may have such deployments, particularly in newer or upgraded facilities.
OT/IT Convergence Initiatives: The existence of a "Senior Specialist - Process Control (OT Cybersecurity Admin)," Trigg Gayle, within the CISO's team 8 strongly suggests that Westlake is actively addressing the security implications of OT/IT convergence. This indicates a level of maturity in recognizing the need to bridge the traditional gap between enterprise IT and industrial OT environments.
The nature of Westlake's business, centered on chemical processing and materials manufacturing, inherently relies on these OT systems. Key production sites, such as the ethylene facilities in Calvert City, Kentucky, and Lake Charles, Louisiana 7, are examples of complex industrial environments heavily dependent on OT. Historically, OT systems were often designed for reliability and safety within physically isolated networks. However, the drive for operational efficiency, remote monitoring, and data integration has led to increased connectivity between IT and OT networks. This convergence, while offering business benefits, significantly expands the attack surface of OT environments, making them susceptible to cyber threats that could disrupt production, compromise safety, or lead to environmental incidents. Westlake's strong stated focus on Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) 2 means that any cyber event impacting OT and leading to such consequences would be a paramount concern.
The extensive M&A activity undertaken by Westlake 1 further complicates its OT landscape. Each acquired company (e.g., Axiall, Vinnolit, NAKAN, Boral's North American building products businesses, Hexion's epoxy business) likely brought with it a distinct set of OT systems, potentially from different vendors, of varying ages, and with disparate security postures. Integrating these diverse OT environments into a unified and secure framework is a formidable challenge, often lagging behind the integration of IT systems. Older manufacturing plants, common in the chemical industry, frequently operate on legacy control systems that were not designed with modern cybersecurity threats in mind and can be difficult to patch or upgrade without disrupting operations. The presence of an OT Cybersecurity Administrator 8 acknowledges this complex challenge but also suggests that the sheer scale and diversity of the task might necessitate specialized external expertise.

GTM Analysis Part 3: Strategic Sales Approach & Battle Card
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Westlake Chemical Corporation
Executive Summary
The strategic sales approach for NCC Group to engage Westlake Corporation should capitalize on a confluence of factors: the company's recent large-scale M&A activity and ongoing integration efforts, the appointment of a new CEO likely focused on operational excellence and strategic refinement, a deeply ingrained corporate value of Health, Safety & Environment (HSE), and the existing internal recognition of OT cybersecurity needs evidenced by a dedicated specialist role. The priority level for engagement is high, given these aligning factors and Westlake's scale as a global manufacturing leader.
The expected engagement timeline should initially focus on a 90-day plan for discovery, initial value demonstration (e.g., targeted assessment or PoV), and relationship building with key stakeholders. Primary targets include the CISO, Tim W. Smith, and his OT Cybersecurity Lead, Trigg Gayle, with subsequent engagement of EVPs overseeing the major business segments and potentially the CEO, Jean-Marc Gilson, for strategic initiatives.
The core value proposition centers on enabling Westlake to securely manage its complex, newly expanded global operations by mitigating IT/OT integration risks, enhancing operational resilience and safety (aligning with HSE), protecting critical intellectual property, and maturing its overall cybersecurity posture. Anticipated challenges include justifying investment against other post-M&A priorities, overcoming potential satisfaction with incumbent (though unknown) vendors, and navigating a large, multifaceted organization. Mitigation strategies will involve a phased approach, strong ROI articulation, and leveraging NCC-Dragos's unique combined IT/OT expertise.
Business Initiative Analysis
Understanding Westlake's current business and security initiatives, alongside their financial planning cycles, is crucial for aligning NCC Group's engagement strategy effectively.
Active and Planned Business Initiatives:
Digital Transformation Projects: While specific enterprise-wide projects are not publicly detailed, Robert F. Buesinger's former executive role included "IT and Digital" for a major segment, indicating that digital initiatives have been underway.30 The new CEO, Jean-Marc Gilson, with his background in leading technologically advanced global firms, is likely to prioritize or accelerate digital transformation to enhance efficiency, data analytics, and potentially customer engagement across the newly consolidated enterprise. These initiatives invariably increase reliance on secure and resilient IT and OT infrastructure.
Business Expansion Efforts: Westlake is actively expanding its global footprint, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region with new Westlake Global Compounds plants in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, and Taicang, China.11 Furthermore, a significant ongoing internal initiative is the operational and systems integration of the numerous large businesses acquired between 2016 and 2022 (Axiall, Boral, Hexion, etc.).
Operational Efficiency Programs: A core tenet of Westlake's "Competitiveness" value is "operational excellence with a constant focus on managing costs".2 This, combined with the typical objectives following major M&A and the likely focus of a new CEO, suggests that programs aimed at streamlining operations, optimizing processes, and reducing costs are a continuous priority. Secure and reliable IT/OT systems are fundamental to achieving these efficiencies.
Innovation Initiatives: Westlake maintains a focus on innovation, as evidenced by the existence of "Westlake Innovations, Inc.," led by SVP & Managing Director John T. Chao.23 Additionally, Bridget Confait-Smith, Associate Director of Research, Innovation, Technology and Global Sustainability, highlights the company's work in these areas.49 Protecting the intellectual property stemming from these initiatives is a key security concern.
Product/Service Launches: While specific near-term launches are not detailed, the expansion into new markets (e.g., epoxy resins, broader building products) implies ongoing product development and market introduction efforts.
Current Security and Compliance Projects:
Specific active RFPs related to security or announced security improvement initiatives are not publicly available in the provided research. This is an information gap.
However, given the M&A integrations, it is highly probable that internal projects are focused on harmonizing security policies, consolidating security tools, and assessing the security posture of newly acquired assets.
Compliance Deadlines: Westlake operates in regulated industries. Chemical facilities in the U.S. are subject to Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS). Globally, they face environmental regulations, safety standards (OSHA and international equivalents), and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in Europe). Ensuring compliance across all operations, especially in newly acquired entities, is an ongoing project.
Cyber Insurance Requirements: Companies of Westlake's scale typically carry cyber insurance, which often comes with stringent requirements for security controls and practices. Meeting these requirements can drive specific security projects.
Budget Cycles and Financial Planning:
Fiscal Year Schedule: Based on the timing of earnings calls (e.g., Q1 results in May, Q4 in February) 3, Westlake likely operates on a calendar fiscal year (ending December 31).
Budget Approval Timelines: Specific internal budget approval timelines are not public. Generally, for large corporations, departmental budget planning for the upcoming fiscal year often begins in Q3, with final approvals in Q4 or early Q1.
Capital Expenditure Patterns: Significant capital expenditures have been associated with acquisitions 20 and new plant construction (e.g., Vietnam and China compounding plants 11). Security investments, particularly for large-scale OT projects or enterprise-wide solutions, would likely be treated as capital expenditures or significant operational expenditures requiring thorough justification.
Industry-Specific Priorities:
Safety and Reliability (HSE): As repeatedly emphasized, HSE is paramount in the chemical industry and a core Westlake value.2 This directly translates to a priority for secure and reliable OT systems to prevent incidents.
Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to CFATS, EPA regulations, OSHA standards, and international equivalents is non-negotiable and drives many operational and security practices.
Supply Chain Integrity: Ensuring the security and resilience of their supply chain is critical, as Westlake is a key supplier to numerous downstream industries.
Intellectual Property Protection: Protecting proprietary chemical formulations, manufacturing processes, and R&D data is vital for maintaining competitive advantage.
OT Security Needs Assessment
Westlake's extensive manufacturing operations, significantly expanded through acquisitions, present a complex Operational Technology (OT) security challenge. The inherited diversity in systems, coupled with the critical nature of chemical and materials production, underscores a pressing need for robust OT security measures.
Industrial Systems Landscape:
Manufacturing Facilities: Westlake operates a global network of manufacturing plants producing ethylene, polyethylene, PVC, VCM, chlor-alkali, epoxy resins, and a wide array of building products and specialty compounds.1 Key ethylene production sites are in Calvert City, KY, and Lake Charles, LA.7 Westlake Global Compounds has facilities worldwide, including new plants in Vietnam and China.11 The acquisitions of Axiall, Vinnolit, Boral, and Hexion's epoxy business added numerous specialized manufacturing sites.
Critical Operational Systems: These facilities rely on a multitude of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), including Distributed Control Systems (DCS) for continuous chemical processes, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for discrete automation, and SCADA systems for broader monitoring and control. Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) are also critical in chemical environments.
Supply Chain Connectivity: OT systems may have an increasing number of connections to enterprise networks for production planning, inventory management, and data analytics, as well as potential connections to external suppliers for remote diagnostics or support.
OT Security Maturity:
The presence of a "Senior Specialist - Process Control (OT Cybersecurity Admin)," Trigg Gayle, within the CISO's team 8 indicates a formal recognition of OT security needs and an effort to build internal expertise. This suggests a maturing approach beyond basic IT security.
However, the maturity level is likely inconsistent across the organization due to the numerous acquisitions. Each acquired entity (Axiall, Boral, Hexion, etc.) would have had its own OT infrastructure and security practices, leading to a heterogeneous environment with varying levels of security controls, documentation, and awareness.
Legacy systems, common in older chemical plants, often lack modern security features and may not have been designed for network connectivity, posing significant challenges.
OT Threat Exposure:
Sector-Specific Threat Actors: The chemical manufacturing sector is a target for various threat actors, including those with capabilities to disrupt industrial processes or steal intellectual property. Specific ICS-focused threat groups identified by Dragos, such as VOLTZITE, KAMACITE, or ELECTRUM (depending on their current targeting TTPs for the chemical sector), could pose a direct threat. These groups often conduct reconnaissance and develop tools specifically for ICS environments.
Ransomware: A major threat, with attackers increasingly targeting OT environments to maximize operational impact and pressure for ransom payments.
Industrial Espionage: Theft of proprietary formulas, manufacturing processes, and R&D data.
Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Compromise through third-party vendors providing OT equipment or support services.
Remote Access Risks: Insecurely configured remote access pathways into OT networks can be exploited.
Vulnerable Industrial Protocols: Many legacy industrial protocols lack authentication and encryption, making them susceptible to manipulation.
OT Security Initiatives (Inferred):
The existence of the OT Cybersecurity Administrator role implies ongoing internal initiatives, likely focused on initial risk assessments, inventory efforts, and potentially pilot projects for OT security monitoring or network segmentation in select facilities.
Given the HSE focus, initiatives to ensure the cyber resilience of safety-critical systems are probable.
No specific large-scale OT security projects have been publicly announced.
The numerous acquisitions of distinct manufacturing entities have undoubtedly resulted in a fragmented OT security landscape at Westlake. Each facility brought in via M&A likely operates with its own set of legacy control systems, diverse industrial protocols, and varying levels of pre-existing security measures and documentation. Standardizing security across such a disparate collection of OT environments is a monumental task. This fragmentation represents a significant operational risk, as inconsistencies in security posture can create weak points exploitable by attackers. It also presents a prime opportunity for NCC-Dragos to offer comprehensive OT asset inventory services, risk assessments tailored to industrial environments, and strategic guidance on developing and implementing a unified OT security framework across the enterprise.
