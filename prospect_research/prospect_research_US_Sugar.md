Go-to-Market Analysis: US Sugar
Part I: Organization Profile & Leadership Report
Executive Summary
United States Sugar Corporation (U.S. Sugar) stands as a significant, privately-held agribusiness with deep roots in American agriculture, specializing primarily in sugarcane cultivation and processing, alongside substantial operations in citrus and sweet corn. Founded in 1931, the company is headquartered in Clewiston, Florida, and commands a considerable operational footprint, including extensive land holdings in Florida and, following a major recent acquisition, refining and processing facilities in Georgia and Kentucky.
Key organizational characteristics include its long operational history, a complex ownership structure dominated by an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and charitable foundations established by its founder, Charles Stewart Mott, and a strategic focus on vertical integration, encompassing farming, milling, refining, and its own rail transportation network. This structure influences its governance and strategic priorities, potentially balancing profit motives with employee welfare and philanthropic considerations.
The leadership team, currently headed by President and CEO Kenneth W. McDuffie (appointed October 2023), reflects a blend of long-tenured executives with deep operational expertise and newer appointments, indicative of both continuity and strategic evolution. Recent significant developments, most notably the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company (closed November 2022) and a major upgrade to its enterprise resource planning system with SAP S/4HANA (ongoing in 2024), signal a period of substantial transformation and expansion. These initiatives are aimed at enhancing efficiency, modernizing operations, and strengthening its market position.
Competitively, U.S. Sugar is the largest sugarcane producer in the United States and a major player in the refined sugar market, especially following the Imperial Sugar acquisition. It competes with other large agricultural conglomerates and sugar refiners. The company’s strategic direction emphasizes leveraging technology, maintaining low-cost production of high-quality sugar, and a continued commitment to sustainability and community engagement. These factors, combined with its complex operational and technological landscape, present unique considerations for market engagement.
Organizational Profile
1. Full legal name and corporate structure
The full legal name of the organization is United States Sugar Corporation.1 It operates as a privately owned agricultural business.1 IBISWorld further categorizes its company type as "Other".1 This private status is a critical determinant in its operational and financial transparency, limiting the availability of public data and potentially shaping its decision-making processes and investment horizons differently from publicly traded entities. The "Other" classification, in conjunction with its private nature, points towards a unique or non-standard corporate setup. This is largely attributable to its distinctive ownership composition, which includes a significant Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and substantial holdings by philanthropic foundations.2 Such a structure suggests a governance model that may not align with typical publicly traded companies or purely family-owned private firms, potentially involving a broader array of stakeholder interests or unique approval pathways for significant capital expenditures. Decision-making processes might therefore balance profit generation with considerations for employee welfare, driven by the ESOP, and broader philanthropic objectives, influenced by the foundations.
2. Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
United States Sugar Corporation was founded in 1931.2 Its corporate headquarters is located in Clewiston, Florida, which has been its operational hub since its inception.2
The company's operations are geographically extensive. Its agricultural activities span over 230,000 to 245,000 acres in several Florida counties, including Hendry, Glades, Martin, Palm Beach, and Highlands.2 The primary sugar mill and refinery are situated in Clewiston, Florida.7 A significant expansion of its operational footprint occurred with the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company, which added a refinery at Port Wentworth, Savannah, Georgia, and a sugar transfer and liquification facility in Ludlow, Kentucky, to its assets.8 The long history of the company suggests well-established, potentially deeply ingrained operational processes and the possibility of legacy systems within its infrastructure. The acquisition of Imperial Sugar's geographically dispersed assets in Georgia and Kentucky represents a notable strategic move, extending U.S. Sugar's operational reach far beyond its historical Florida base. This expansion likely introduces considerable IT and OT integration challenges, as disparate systems and cultures from the acquired entity must be harmonized with U.S. Sugar's existing infrastructure. Furthermore, operating in new states may expose the company to different regulatory environments and an expanded cybersecurity attack surface, requiring a comprehensive approach to managing risks across a more distributed enterprise.
3. Organizational history and key milestones
United States Sugar Corporation was established in 1931 when industrialist and philanthropist Charles Stewart Mott acquired the assets of the bankrupt Southern Sugar Company near Clewiston, Florida.2 Throughout its history, the company has navigated periods of significant growth, diversification, technological upgrades, and structural changes.
Key milestones that have shaped the organization include:
1940s: The company faced charges related to slavery violations, a sensitive historical point that may inform contemporary perceptions of its corporate social responsibility.2
1962: Opening of the Bryant Sugar House, which at the time was the world's largest and most modern sugarcane processing mill.2 This facility was later closed in 2007, with operations consolidated to the Clewiston mill as part of efficiency measures.10 This consolidation demonstrates a strategic focus on operational efficiency and modernization, even when requiring difficult business decisions.
1970s: Under the leadership of C.S. Harding Mott, son of the founder, U.S. Sugar diversified its agricultural portfolio to include cattle, citrus, and vegetables.2
1980: Acquisition of South Bay Growers, further expanding its vegetable operations.2
1983: Formation of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) as part of a strategy to take the company private.2
1990s: U.S. Sugar became the first fully integrated refinery in the nation with the addition of the Clewiston Refinery, enabling complete processing from field to consumer.7
2002: The Clewiston refinery was expanded to include liquid sugar capabilities, and its subsidiary, Southern Gardens Citrus, acquired Alcoma Groves, increasing its citrus acreage.7
2008: The Clewiston milling and refining facility was recognized as the world’s largest vertically integrated sugarcane milling and refining facility.7
2021-2022: A landmark development was the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company from Louis Dreyfus Company, a move that significantly increased U.S. Sugar's refining capacity and market presence.9
October 2023: Kenneth W. McDuffie was appointed President and CEO, marking a significant leadership transition.15
2024 (Ongoing): Announcement and implementation of a major upgrade to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, representing a substantial technological transformation.17
This consistent pattern of investment in operational capacity and technology suggests a corporate culture that, despite its long history, values modernization and is willing to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitiveness and efficiency. This historical behavior could indicate a similar preparedness to invest in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and services, particularly if a clear business case for risk mitigation and protection of these substantial investments is presented.
4. Industry classification and primary business activities
U.S. Sugar Corporation's primary business activities are centered on agriculture and food production. It is recognized as the largest producer of sugarcane in the United States.2 Beyond sugarcane, the company also produces refined sugar, sweet corn, and oranges.2 A key operational feature is its ownership and operation of an internal rail system, the South Central Florida Express, for transporting its agricultural products.7 The company describes itself as a fully integrated producer of sugarcane, one of Florida's major producers of orange juice products (through its Southern Gardens Citrus division), and a regional short-line railroad operator.19 Its product portfolio includes raw inputs like seeds, intermediate products like bagasse and milled sugar, and finished products like refined sugar.1
The company operates within the Agricultural industry 2 and the Food & Beverage sector.20 Specific industry classifications include:
NAICS Codes:
111 - Crop Production 21
111930 - Sugarcane Farming (also cited as 11193 - Sugarcane Harvesting) 1
Potentially 31131 - Sugar Manufacturing (covering refining activities)
SIC Codes:
0133 - Sugarcane and Sugar Beets 22
2061 - Cane Sugar, Except Refining 23
2062 - Cane Sugar Refining 23
The vertical integration of U.S. Sugar—encompassing sugarcane farming, extensive processing and refining operations, and its own railroad for transport—creates a highly interconnected and complex operational environment.7 While this integration offers significant efficiencies and control over the supply chain, it also means that a cyber incident in one segment of the value chain could have cascading disruptive effects on other operations. For instance, an OT security incident affecting the railroad could halt sugarcane transport to the mills, or an attack on industrial control systems in processing plants could lead to production stoppages or spoilage of raw materials, ultimately resulting in substantial financial losses. This interconnectedness underscores the critical need for a holistic security strategy that addresses both IT and OT environments.
5. Precise company size metrics
Annual Revenue:
Precise, recent, consolidated annual revenue figures for U.S. Sugar, especially after the Imperial Sugar acquisition, are not publicly available due to its private status.
Older estimates from 2008 placed U.S. Sugar's annual revenue in the range of approximately $604 million to $657.5 million, with breakdowns for sugar, citrus, and rail operations.24
More recent contextual data from a November 2021 Department of Justice press release (referring to 2020 figures) indicated that U.S. Sugar received payments of $533 million from the United Sugars cooperative, its marketing arm.26 The same release noted that Imperial Sugar's revenues were over $700 million in 2020.26
The acquisition of Imperial Sugar, a company with 2020 revenues comparable to or exceeding U.S. Sugar's own pre-acquisition indicators, strongly suggests that U.S. Sugar's current total revenue substantially exceeds $1 billion annually. This rapid expansion in operational scale and market presence creates immense pressure for integrating systems, processes, and security postures across the newly combined entity.
Competitor revenues further support this scale: Florida Crystals Corporation reported 2024 revenues cited between $562 million (LeadIQ) and $1.6 billion (industry blog), and American Crystal Sugar Company's 2024 revenues were cited between $411.3 million (Growjo) and $931.8 million (industry blog).27
Information Gap: A precise current annual revenue figure and a 3-year trend for the combined U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar entity are not publicly available.
Employee Count:
Estimates for U.S. Sugar's employee count consistently range from 2,500 to 3,000 individuals.1 This represents a significant workforce for a privately held agribusiness.
Market Capitalization:
As a privately held company, U.S. Sugar is not publicly traded and therefore does not have a market capitalization.1 Its valuation would be determined by private assessments, which would likely be substantial given its extensive assets, market position, and revenue scale.
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
Specific financial growth rates for U.S. Sugar are not publicly disclosed. However, the strategic acquisition of Imperial Sugar implies a significant step-change in growth and market presence. The company's "2024 Report To Stockholders" indicated that the 2023-2024 sugarcane crop was the third largest in its history, and the Clewiston Refinery operated ahead of budget, suggesting positive operational performance and likely revenue growth.18
The broader U.S. sugar market has seen price fluctuations and varied production forecasts.31 While some analysts project strong growth for the U.S. sugar market 34, others indicate more modest expansion.35 USDA forecasts for the U.S. 2025/26 sugar supply indicate a potential lowering compared to the prior year, while global production is projected to increase.32
Information Gap: Specific financial growth rates and a detailed financial trajectory for U.S. Sugar are not publicly available.
6. Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
U.S. Sugar's operational headquarters remains in Clewiston, Florida.2 Its agricultural land holdings are concentrated in South and Central Florida, encompassing 230,000 to 245,000 acres across Hendry, Glades, Martin, Palm Beach, and Highlands counties.2
The company's key processing and logistical sites include:

Location
Type of Facility
Estimated Size/Capacity
Clewiston, FL
Vertically Integrated Sugarcane Mill & Refinery
Processes up to 42,000 tons sugarcane/day; produces ~800,000-850,000 tons sugar/year 7
Port Wentworth, Savannah, GA
Sugar Refinery (ex-Imperial Sugar)
Current capacity ~805,000 short tons/year; planned expansion to 875,000 short tons/year 8
Ludlow, KY
Sugar Transfer & Liquification (ex-Imperial Sugar)
Serves as a key logistical hub 8
Florida (various locations)
Citrus Groves & Processing Plant (Southern Gardens)
Over 30,000 acres of citrus groves; processing plant with 120 million gallons/year juice capacity 7
South & Central Florida
Railroad System (South Central Florida Express)
Over 120 miles of track; 14 locomotives, ~1,000 railcars 12
Florida (various locations)
Vegetable Farming (Rouge River Farms)
Significant acreage for sweet corn and green beans 16

This expanded geographic footprint, particularly with the integration of the Imperial Sugar facilities, increases logistical complexity and underscores the need for secure, interconnected systems for communication and operational control across diverse locations. Each major facility represents a critical node within the company's broader IT and OT network.
7. Detailed corporate structure
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: United States Sugar Corporation is the principal entity. Key subsidiaries or operating divisions include Southern Gardens Citrus (focused on citrus products) 2 and, following its acquisition, Imperial Sugar Company (encompassing its refining assets and consumer brands).9
Business Units and Divisions: The company operates through several distinct business units:
Sugarcane Farming and Raw Sugar Production
Sugar Refining (Clewiston and Savannah facilities, including Imperial Sugar brands like Imperial®, Dixie Crystals®, White Gold®, and Holly Sugar® 8)
Citrus Operations (Southern Gardens Citrus)
Vegetable Farming (Rouge River Farms) 16
Railroad Operations (South Central Florida Express) 19
Next Generation Energy (utilizing bagasse for biofuel) 18
An Industrial Skills Training Academy (ISTA) is also part of its structure, focused on talent development.18 Each of these units possesses unique operational characteristics and technological requirements, particularly concerning OT security. The acquisition of Imperial Sugar's brands significantly expands U.S. Sugar's product portfolio and market reach, especially in consumer-facing segments. This diversification into more prominent consumer brands may heighten the company's sensitivity to reputational damage arising from cyber incidents, such as data breaches or production disruptions that affect brand availability and consumer trust.
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: The most significant recent restructuring initiative is the ongoing acquisition and integration of Imperial Sugar Company.9 This involves incorporating Imperial's Port Wentworth refinery and Ludlow facility into U.S. Sugar's operational framework. A major component of this is the $35.65 million multi-year Centrifuge Improvement Project at the Savannah refinery, aimed at modernizing and expanding its capabilities.18 Concurrently, the company-wide upgrade to SAP S/4HANA represents a fundamental business process and IT restructuring effort, designed to enhance efficiency and data management across the consolidated enterprise.17 These large-scale initiatives create both operational risks during the transition phases and strategic opportunities for implementing new, robust security solutions.
Merger and Acquisition History:
1980: Acquired South Bay Growers, expanding into vegetable production.2 (Note: Most of South Bay Growers was subsequently closed in 1994 2).
March 2021 - November 2022: Announced the agreement to acquire Imperial Sugar Company from Louis Dreyfus Company for approximately $315 million (later adjusted to $297 million).8 The deal faced an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice but was ultimately allowed to proceed, closing in November 2022.14 This acquisition is the most impactful M&A activity in recent history and is central to understanding U.S. Sugar's current strategic posture and operational needs.
8. Ownership structure
Public Trading Information: United States Sugar Corporation is a privately held company and is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.1
Private Equity Ownership Details: The company has a unique ownership structure. It is primarily owned by its employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which holds an estimated 40% stake.2 Significant ownership is also held by charitable foundations established by the founder, Charles Stewart Mott. These include The C.S. Mott Foundation (approximately 19%) and The Mott Children's Health Center (approximately 22%).2 The Community Foundation of Greater Flint also holds a smaller stake (approximately 6%).2 This complex stakeholder environment, particularly the substantial ownership by philanthropic foundations and the ESOP, likely influences corporate strategy. The Mott Foundation's focus on areas such as environmental stewardship and community well-being 4 may mean that U.S. Sugar is more receptive to arguments for cybersecurity investments that are framed around long-term sustainability, protection of critical food infrastructure, community impact (e.g., job protection through operational resilience), and responsible business practices, rather than solely on short-term financial ROI. The direct link is further solidified by Ridgway H. White, President and CEO of the Mott Foundation, also serving as Chairman of U.S. Sugar's Board of Directors.39
Recent Ownership Changes: There have been no fundamental changes to this core ESOP and foundation-based ownership structure in recent years. The company transitioned to private ownership in 1987 through the establishment of the ESOP.2 Historical events include past lawsuits related to ESOP share valuation.2

The appointment of Kenneth McDuffie as CEO in October 2023, an insider with an extensive background in U.S. Sugar's agricultural operations and a documented focus on modernization and technology, signals a strategic direction emphasizing operational excellence.15 His rise from a farm assistant to CEO underscores a deep understanding of the company's core business and may indicate a leadership style that values operational resilience and efficiency, aligning well with the benefits of robust OT and IT security. His public statements emphasize "harnessing more technology to grow food more sustainably" 16, further highlighting the importance of secure technological infrastructure.
The IT leadership, with Carl Stringer as VP IT since 2004 and Matthew Miller as Sr. Director of IT Business Solutions heavily involved in the recent SAP S/4HANA migration and Pathlock implementation, indicates an established team familiar with large-scale technology projects and compliance requirements.49 This experience suggests they would be key decision-makers for cybersecurity investments and receptive to solutions addressing risks associated with major system changes and integrations. Their work with Pathlock demonstrates an existing awareness of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) needs within their enterprise systems.51
Information Gaps: Detailed career histories, educational backgrounds, specific achievements, and public speaking engagements or publications are limited for several C-suite members, including the CFO and COO, and other VPs from the provided materials. Access to professional social media profiles like LinkedIn, which could provide such details, was largely unavailable.

The composition of the Board, particularly with Ridgway H. White as Chairman while also leading The Mott Foundation (a major shareholder), underscores a strong alignment between the company's governance and the Foundation's long-term interests.4 These interests often extend beyond pure financial returns to include sustainability, community impact, and responsible corporate citizenship. Consequently, cybersecurity initiatives presented to the Board may find greater traction if they are framed not only in terms of ROI but also as measures that protect long-term shareholder value (including ESOP participants), ensure operational stability (safeguarding jobs and community well-being), and uphold the company's reputation as a responsible steward of its resources and legacy.
Information Gaps: Detailed profiles, full committee assignments (beyond Horace Wilkins, Jr.), and other board affiliations for several members (John K. Butler, Eric S. Peterson, Roy E. Peterson, Timothy C. Sanford, Todd L. Wisely) were not available in the provided materials.
3. IT and Security leadership
The primary IT leadership identified within U.S. Sugar includes:
Carl Stringer, VP IT and Employee Benefits: He appears to be the most senior executive dedicated to information technology, having been with the company since 2004.47 His responsibilities encompass overseeing the IT department and its strategic direction, including major projects like the SAP S/4HANA migration.50
Matthew Miller, Sr. Director of IT Business Solutions and Benefits: Reporting to Carl Stringer, Miller has played a crucial role in the recent SAP S/4HANA migration and the implementation of Pathlock for Segregation of Duties (SoD).51 His role suggests a focus on the secure and efficient deployment of enterprise applications and managing associated compliance and risk.
No individual with the explicit title of Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) was identified from the available information for U.S. Sugar. The absence of a dedicated CISO role, based on current public data, suggests that overall cybersecurity strategy, decision-making, and oversight may reside with the VP of IT, Carl Stringer, or could be distributed among senior IT staff like Matthew Miller, particularly concerning application security and GRC. This organizational structure could present an opportunity for specialized cybersecurity advisory services to help define or mature the strategic security function, especially given the increased complexity following the Imperial Sugar acquisition and the SAP transformation. Alternatively, it may indicate that Mr. Stringer is a highly influential and centralized decision-maker for all security-related investments.
Information Gaps: Specific individuals in roles such as security operations leadership, dedicated compliance and risk management leadership (beyond Matthew Miller's involvement with SoD tools), or distinct digital transformation leadership (though Stringer and Miller are central to the SAP project) are not clearly identified in the publicly available information.
4. Middle management in relevant departments
Specific names or detailed roles of middle management within IT infrastructure, security operations, network and systems administration, or procurement and vendor management at U.S. Sugar are not available from the provided research materials. Identifying these individuals would typically require direct engagement or deeper internal discovery. These roles are often crucial for the practical implementation of cybersecurity solutions and can be significant influencers in technology selection processes.
Information Gap: This represents a notable information gap that would need to be addressed during the sales discovery phase to understand the operational IT and security teams and procurement processes more thoroughly.
5. Decision-making patterns
As a privately held company with a distinctive ownership structure involving an ESOP and major charitable foundations, U.S. Sugar's decision-making processes for significant investments are likely more nuanced than those of a typical publicly traded corporation. The Board of Directors, particularly Chairman Ridgway H. White (who also leads the Mott Foundation), is expected to wield considerable influence on major strategic investments that impact the company's long-term trajectory and risk posture.39
The successful execution of the Imperial Sugar acquisition, despite a DOJ challenge 14, and the ongoing large-scale SAP S/4HANA migration 18, demonstrate that the organization possesses established, albeit internal, mechanisms for evaluating, approving, and funding complex, multi-million dollar strategic initiatives. This history suggests a capacity for thorough due diligence and strategic execution.
For technology purchases, especially significant cybersecurity investments, the approval process would likely involve several key stakeholders:
IT Leadership (Carl Stringer and Matthew Miller): Would identify the technical need, vet solutions, and champion the proposal internally.
Chief Financial Officer (Elaine Wood): Would scrutinize the budgetary impact, potential ROI, and overall financial justification.
Chief Executive Officer (Kenneth W. McDuffie): Would provide final executive approval, assessing the proposal's alignment with overarching strategic priorities, operational impact, and risk mitigation benefits.
Board of Directors: For investments of a particularly large scale or those deemed strategically critical to the company's risk profile or long-term stability, Board approval would likely be necessary.
The successful navigation of large, complex projects implies that while the specific thresholds and detailed budget authorities are not public, a formal process is in place. A well-justified cybersecurity proposal that clearly articulates value, addresses tangible risks (especially those heightened by recent acquisitions and system migrations), and aligns with strategic goals such as modernization and operational efficiency is likely to receive serious consideration.
Information Gap: Specific financial approval thresholds and detailed budget authorities for technology purchases are not publicly available.

Ongoing (2024-2025)
Fluctuations in global/US sugar prices and production forecasts by USDA, etc. 37
Market volatility underscores the need for operational efficiency and cost control, where resilient and secure systems play a key role in preventing costly disruptions.

The concurrent major events—a CEO transition and a fundamental ERP system upgrade (SAP S/4HANA)—create a unique period of organizational flux and strategic reassessment. Such dual transformations often open windows where existing processes are critically examined, and new solutions, including comprehensive cybersecurity measures, may be more readily considered to support and secure these significant changes. A new CEO often seeks to establish their strategic vision, and McDuffie's emphasis on technology and sustainability aligns well with the need for robust digital security.16 Simultaneously, a major ERP overhaul necessitates a thorough review of business processes, data governance, and security controls, making it an opportune moment to address both existing and emerging cyber risks.
Press releases and company communications during this period have centered on these leadership changes, the SAP S/4HANA upgrade, ongoing community engagement efforts (e.g., support for local infrastructure, education, and charitable causes), and environmental stewardship achievements.16 As a private company, U.S. Sugar does not hold public earnings calls, and specific analyst reports on the company are rare. Market commentary primarily focuses on broader sugar industry trends, prices, and supply/demand dynamics.
2. Strategic initiatives
U.S. Sugar's strategic direction, as articulated in its "2024 Report To Stockholders" and statements by its new CEO, centers on modernization, efficiency, and sustainable growth.16
Stated Vision, Mission, and Purpose:
Vision: "To be the low-cost producer of high quality, refined sugar."
Mission: "Maximize long-term shareholder value."
Purpose: "Sustainably feed American families for the next 100 years."
Strategic Pillars:
Focus on our core: Concentrating on the primary sugar business.
Be the low-cost producer: Driving efficiency across operations.
Embrace technology as an enabler: Leveraging technology for competitive advantage and sustainability.
Key strategic initiatives flowing from these pillars include:
SAP S/4HANA Upgrade: This is a central initiative aimed at creating data-driven operations, enhancing efficiency, and improving decision-making capabilities across the enterprise.18 The project involves integrating key agricultural processes with ERP elements of the supply chain. This digitalization journey inherently expands the cyber attack surface and elevates the criticality of data integrity and system availability, making robust cybersecurity an essential, non-negotiable component of this strategy.
Operational Modernization: Continued investment in agricultural research (new sugarcane varieties like FLB Barbados and the Brazilian RB variety), modernization of the acquired Savannah refinery (including the $35.65 million Centrifuge Improvement Project), and upgrades to its railroad infrastructure (including testing AI-powered autonomous features).18
Sustainability and Energy Efficiency: Expansion of its "Next Generation Energy" program, which uses bagasse (sugarcane fiber) as a biofuel to power its facilities, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Ongoing commitment to Everglades restoration, phosphorus reduction in water runoff, and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farming operations.18
Talent Development: Investment in programs like the Industrial Skills Training Academy (ISTA) to cultivate a skilled workforce.18
CEO Kenneth McDuffie's public statements reinforce these themes, particularly the focus on "harnessing more technology to grow food more sustainably" and ensuring U.S. Sugar remains a market leader in safe and efficient production.16 The clear strategic emphasis on technology as an enabler provides a strong rationale for positioning cybersecurity services as critical to the successful and secure realization of these goals.
3. Organizational changes
Leadership Appointments and Departures: The most significant leadership change has been the appointment of Kenneth W. McDuffie as President & CEO in October 2023, succeeding Robert H. Buker, Jr..16 This transition brings a leader with deep operational and modernization experience to the helm. Other notable changes include the retirement of Judy Clayton Sanchez, Senior Director of Corporate Communications & Public Affairs, with Ryan Duffy taking on the role of Director of Corporate Communications.17 Eric Edwards was also promoted to Senior Vice President, Public Affairs.17
Restructuring and Realignments: The primary organizational restructuring revolves around the integration of Imperial Sugar Company. This involves absorbing its facilities, brands, and personnel into U.S. Sugar's structure and aligning its operations with U.S. Sugar's strategic objectives.18 No other major business unit realignments have been publicly announced.
Office Openings, Closings, or Relocations: The acquisition of Imperial Sugar brought new operational sites in Port Wentworth, GA, and Ludlow, KY, into U.S. Sugar's portfolio.9 There is no indication of recent office closures or major relocations beyond the historical consolidation of the Bryant Sugar House operations to Clewiston in 2007.10
These organizational changes, particularly the CEO transition and the complex integration of Imperial Sugar, create a dynamic environment where security needs may be re-evaluated to address new risks and support evolving operational models.
4. Financial developments
As a private company, U.S. Sugar does not publicly disclose detailed financial performance or engage in public funding rounds. However, several developments indicate significant financial activity and strategic investment:
Major Investments and Expenditures:
The acquisition of Imperial Sugar for $297 million to $315 million represents a substantial capital outlay.8
The company-wide upgrade to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition is a multi-million dollar investment in its technological backbone.18
The $35.65 million multi-year Centrifuge Improvement Project at the Savannah Sugar Refinery is a significant modernization expenditure.18
Ongoing investments are also being made in railroad upgrades, advanced agricultural technologies (such as precision agriculture tools and drone technology), and sugarcane research and development.18 These substantial financial commitments to acquiring new assets and modernizing existing ones highlight areas of high value that require robust protection. A cyber incident impacting these projects could lead to significant financial losses, operational delays, and jeopardize the anticipated returns on these strategic investments.
Cost-Cutting Initiatives: One of U.S. Sugar's core strategic pillars is to "Be the low-cost producer".18 This implies a continuous focus on operational efficiency and prudent cost management. Modernization efforts, such as the SAP upgrade and refinery improvements, are aligned with this goal. This focus on cost efficiency means that cybersecurity solutions should be presented with a clear articulation of ROI, risk reduction value, and how they contribute to overall operational stability and cost avoidance (e.g., preventing costly downtime or incident response).
Changes in Financial Reporting or Structure: The integration of Imperial Sugar's financial operations and the implementation of the new SAP S/4HANA system will fundamentally transform U.S. Sugar's financial data management and reporting processes. This transition period is critical for ensuring data integrity and security within the new financial systems.

U.S. Sugar holds a dominant position as the largest producer of sugarcane in the United States by volume, harvesting over 700,000 tonnes annually prior to any combined figures post-Imperial acquisition.2 Its market share in U.S. sugarcane harvesting is estimated at approximately 24.7%.1 Before acquiring Imperial, U.S. Sugar accounted for roughly 8-13% of total U.S. sugar production (refined and raw beet/cane combined).7 The acquisition of Imperial Sugar, which itself had significant refining capacity (Port Wentworth refinery capacity of 805,000 short tons, with plans to expand to 875,000 short tons 8), substantially enhances U.S. Sugar's refining capabilities (Clewiston capacity of 850,000 tons 8) and market share in the refined sugar segment. This positions U.S. Sugar as a more direct and formidable competitor to ASR Group (North America's largest refiner 27) and Florida Crystals, particularly in the southeastern United States. This heightened competitive environment often compels companies to seek greater operational efficiencies, ensure supply chain resilience, and implement stringent cost controls—all areas where secure and reliable IT and OT systems are critical for success. The Department of Justice, during its review of the Imperial Sugar acquisition, identified the pre-merger market in the Southeast as primarily consisting of U.S. Sugar (via United Sugars cooperative), Imperial Sugar, and ASR/Domino.26 Post-acquisition, this dynamic shifts to essentially two major players: U.S. Sugar (now incorporating Imperial) and ASR/Domino.
Competitive advantages for U.S. Sugar include its extensive vertical integration, significant land assets in Florida, large-scale production capabilities, and a modernized Clewiston facility.7 The ESOP structure may also foster employee dedication.30 Potential disadvantages include the complexities of integrating the newly acquired Imperial Sugar assets and their legacy systems, exposure to Florida-specific agricultural risks like hurricanes and crop diseases 7, and a historical reliance on the U.S. sugar program's protections.76 While the company actively promotes its environmental stewardship 50, historical environmental concerns related to the Everglades remain a sensitive area.4
2. Industry standing
Industry Rankings and Awards: U.S. Sugar is consistently recognized as the largest sugarcane producer in the United States.2 Its Clewiston facility has been noted as the world's largest vertically integrated sugarcane milling and refining operation.7 The company has received recognition for its environmental practices, such as the Energy Institute’s Environment Award in 2008 for its innovative boiler system that utilizes bagasse for clean energy.62 More recently, its Clewiston Refinery maintained an "Excellent" (100 out of 100) SQF 9.0 Food Safety and Food Quality Certification, renewed in January 2024, and also renewed its non-GMO certification in July 2024.18
Market Share Trends: As noted, U.S. Sugar holds approximately 24.7% of the U.S. sugarcane harvesting market 1 and contributes a significant percentage (variously estimated around 10-13%) to the nation's overall sugar production.7 Its market share in the refined sugar sector has undoubtedly increased following the Imperial Sugar acquisition. Maintaining and growing this share in a competitive commodity market necessitates high levels of operational efficiency and reliability, which robust cybersecurity measures directly support by minimizing disruptions and protecting sensitive operational data.

Part II: Technical Infrastructure & Security Posture Report
Executive Summary
United States Sugar Corporation (U.S. Sugar) operates a complex and increasingly sophisticated technical environment, characterized by a hybrid IT/OT landscape essential to its core agribusiness functions spanning large-scale farming, advanced processing and refining, and extensive logistics including its own railroad. A pivotal recent development is the major IT transformation initiative involving an upgrade to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, signaling a strategic move towards enhanced digitalization and operational integration.
Key findings regarding its security posture indicate a degree of proactive security management, evidenced by the implementation of Pathlock for Segregation of Duties (SoD) within its SAP environment, including across newly acquired legacy systems. However, the significantly expanded operational footprint resulting from the Imperial Sugar acquisition, coupled with the inherent vulnerabilities of diverse and geographically distributed Operational Technology (OT) environments, presents considerable security challenges. The integration of legacy systems from Imperial Sugar, securing the new, expansive SAP S/4HANA environment, and effectively managing OT vulnerabilities across its varied agricultural, manufacturing, and transportation operations are critical technical hurdles.
The current vendor landscape is prominently shaped by SAP as a strategic technology partner and Pathlock for access governance solutions. A broader understanding of its security-specific vendor ecosystem remains an area for further discovery. Primary security threats and risks pertinent to U.S. Sugar include ransomware targeting manufacturing and OT systems (which could cripple production), disruptions to its intricate supply chain, potential data breaches (particularly concerning with the addition of consumer-facing brands from Imperial Sugar), and insider threats, which can be accentuated during periods of significant organizational change and systems integration. The convergence of IT and OT, driven by digital transformation, further amplifies these risks if not managed with a robust and holistic security strategy.
Technology Infrastructure Analysis
1. Detailed technology stack analysis
Enterprise Systems (ERP, CRM, etc.):
The cornerstone of U.S. Sugar's enterprise systems is its recent and ongoing upgrade to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, facilitated by the RISE with SAP offering.17 This initiative, reported as having its agreement finalized in 2024, is a comprehensive digital transformation effort aimed at modernizing core ERP functionalities such as finance and procurement. Crucially, it also intends to integrate key agricultural processes—including planting, fertilizing, irrigating, and harvesting—with enterprise-level supply chain management, thereby creating a more data-driven and efficient operational model.50 This migration to a cloud-based ERP signifies a major shift towards a more centralized and potentially more interconnected enterprise architecture. While this offers substantial benefits in terms of scalability and accessibility, it also introduces new security considerations related to cloud environments, secure data migration, API security, and the protection of hybrid connections, as some infrastructure components may remain on-premise. Although RISE with SAP means SAP manages a significant portion of the underlying infrastructure, U.S. Sugar retains responsibility for critical aspects such as data security, fine-grained access controls, and securing their connectivity to the cloud environment. The direct integration of agricultural process data into this ERP system elevates the importance of its security, as OT data may traverse or reside within this platform.
Complementing its SAP environment, U.S. Sugar utilizes Pathlock for advanced Segregation of Duties (SoD) analysis and access governance.51 Notably, Pathlock is being employed to manage SoD risks not only within the new SAP S/4HANA system but also across legacy systems, such as the PeopleSoft application used at the acquired Imperial Sugar refinery in Savannah.51 This deployment indicates an awareness of the complexities involved in integrating disparate enterprise systems from acquisitions and a proactive approach to managing access-related risks. However, while Pathlock addresses a critical layer of application security (access control and SoD), the broader integration of legacy systems like PeopleSoft with a modern ERP like S/4HANA involves extensive data mapping, API development, and potentially custom middleware. These integration points can introduce new vulnerabilities if not securely designed, implemented, and continuously monitored.
The company also acknowledges the use of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications that are networked and require a cross-application view for access management, although the specific CRM system in use is not publicly identified.51
Cloud Services and Providers in Use:
The most significant cloud deployment is SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition with RISE with SAP.18 This implies a reliance on SAP's managed cloud infrastructure, which typically runs on a major hyperscaler platform such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with SAP overseeing the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) layer. Details on other specific cloud services or providers utilized by U.S. Sugar are not available in the public domain.
Network Architecture:
Specific details of U.S. Sugar's network architecture are not publicly known. However, the geographically distributed nature of its operations—encompassing extensive farmlands across Florida, the Clewiston headquarters and processing facility, the acquired Imperial Sugar sites in Savannah, Georgia, and Ludlow, Kentucky, and its private railroad network—necessitates a robust Wide Area Network (WAN) to interconnect these locations. The security of this WAN, including segmentation strategies and remote access controls, is critical.
Information Gap: Comprehensive details regarding U.S. Sugar's network architecture, segmentation strategies, and specific network security controls are not publicly available.
Data Center Locations and Capabilities:
With the transition to RISE with SAP, the primary data centers hosting the SAP S/4HANA environment will be managed by SAP and its chosen IaaS partner(s). It is probable that U.S. Sugar continues to maintain on-premise data centers or server rooms for legacy applications, Operational Technology (OT) control systems, local data storage, and other non-ERP workloads.
Information Gap: The locations, scale, and capabilities of any on-premise data centers operated by U.S. Sugar are not detailed in public sources.
Hardware and Software Vendors:
Key technology vendors identified include:
SAP: Strategic partner for ERP (S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition).18
Pathlock: Provider of access governance and Segregation of Duties (SoD) solutions.51
John Deere: Supplier of precision agriculture technology (Auto Field Cruise).18
Hiphen: Provider of drone technology and analytics for agricultural applications.18

Legacy Systems and Modernization Efforts: The SAP S/4HANA migration is the centerpiece of U.S. Sugar's current modernization strategy, intended to replace older ERP systems and streamline business processes.18 The PeopleSoft system at the acquired Savannah refinery is a notable legacy system that is being addressed from an access governance perspective through Pathlock, indicating an ongoing integration challenge.51 The "2024 Report To Stockholders" also details other modernization efforts, such as the multi-year Centrifuge Improvement Project at the Savannah refinery, aimed at upgrading critical production equipment.18 The presence of such legacy systems alongside new modernization projects underscores the need for robust security assessments to identify and mitigate inherited security debt and ensure that new systems are implemented with security by design.
2. Operational Technology (OT) environments
U.S. Sugar's core business is heavily reliant on a diverse and extensive range of Operational Technology (OT) environments. These systems are fundamental to its agricultural production, processing, refining, and logistical operations.
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in Use: The company operates large-scale sugar mills in Clewiston, FL, and Savannah, GA, a significant citrus processing plant (Southern Gardens Citrus), and an extensive private agricultural railroad network.7 Each of these facilities inherently utilizes Industrial Control Systems (ICS) for process automation, real-time monitoring, and safety functions. The Clewiston facility, in particular, features highly automated sugarcane operations, from milling to refining.7 The "2024 Report To Stockholders" references the conversion of the C Tandem to an electric drive system and new centrifugal stations at the Savannah refinery, all of which are indicative of complex ICS deployments.18 Company statements confirm that all farming and factory operations run on sophisticated machinery that is 100% integrated into the business, utilizing sensors and control systems.50 This deep integration and reliance make the security of these ICS environments paramount.
SCADA Systems and Protocols: While specific Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems or industrial protocols are not publicly named, their use is highly probable for managing and monitoring distributed operations. This includes irrigation systems across vast farmlands, the extensive railroad network, and various processes within the manufacturing plants.
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES): MES solutions are likely deployed within the processing and refining plants to manage and track production workflows, quality control, and inventory. A key objective of the SAP S/4HANA implementation is the integration of such plant-level systems with the enterprise ERP for a unified view of operations.50
Building Automation Systems (BAS): For large industrial facilities like refineries and corporate offices, BAS for managing HVAC, lighting, and physical security are likely in place, though not specifically detailed in available information.
IoT Deployments and Connected Devices: U.S. Sugar is actively adopting Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected technologies to enhance its operations. Examples include:
John Deere’s Auto Field Cruise technology for precision agriculture, optimizing fuel usage and field operations.18
Hiphen drone technology for advanced agricultural applications such as sugarcane variety selection, plant biovolume estimation, and aiding in the detection and management of muck fires.18
The railroad division is testing Network Controlled Locomotives that incorporate AI and autonomous features.18
Widespread deployment of sensors and control systems throughout farming and factory operations for real-time data acquisition and process control.50 The increasing deployment of these connected devices, while driving innovation and efficiency, significantly expands the OT attack surface and introduces new potential threat vectors that require specialized security considerations.
OT/IT Convergence Initiatives: There is clear evidence of increasing OT/IT convergence at U.S. Sugar. The strategic SAP S/4HANA project explicitly aims to integrate key agricultural (OT) processes with the enterprise (IT) resource planning system.50 Furthermore, the use of Pathlock to analyze Segregation of Duties across both SAP (IT) and the legacy PeopleSoft system (IT, but supporting OT-related plant operations at Savannah) underscores this trend.51 This convergence, while beneficial for achieving unified operational visibility and efficiency, also blurs traditional network perimeters and can expose critical OT systems to threats originating from the IT network if not architected and secured appropriately.
The extensive and critical nature of U.S. Sugar's OT environments—spanning large-scale precision agriculture, the largest private short-line railroad in the U.S. 38, and complex sugar milling and refining facilities—represents a significant and potentially vulnerable attack surface. The company's direct reliance on these systems for its entire revenue-generating lifecycle makes their security a high-stakes concern. Any disruption to these OT systems could lead to immediate and substantial impacts, including spoilage of perishable agricultural products, halts in production, inability to transport goods, and ultimately, significant financial losses.
Conceptual OT Environment Map (Illustrative)
(This would ideally be a diagram, but will be described textually here)
U.S. Sugar's OT landscape can be conceptualized across several key domains:
Farming Operations (Florida):
Precision Agriculture Systems (e.g., John Deere Auto Field Cruise, GPS-guided equipment)
Irrigation Control Systems (likely SCADA-based)
Drone Systems (e.g., Hiphen for crop monitoring, surveying)
Environmental Monitoring Sensors
Railroad Operations (South Central Florida Express):
Locomotive Control Systems (including new Network Controlled Locomotives with AI/autonomous features)
Signaling and Switching Systems
Rail Yard Management Systems
Automated Bridge Control Systems (e.g., Moore Haven swing bridge automation) 18
Clewiston Mill & Refinery (Florida):
ICS/DCS for sugarcane milling (crushers, diffusers, evaporators, centrifuges)
ICS/DCS for sugar refining (clarification, crystallization, drying, packaging)
Boiler Control Systems (for bagasse-fired power generation)
Automated Packaging Lines
Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)
Savannah Refinery (Georgia - ex-Imperial):
ICS/DCS for raw sugar refining (similar processes to Clewiston, undergoing centrifuge upgrades)
Liquid Sugar Production Controls
Legacy systems (e.g., interfaces to PeopleSoft for plant data)
Ludlow Transfer Facility (Kentucky - ex-Imperial):
Material Handling Control Systems
Tank Farm Monitoring/Control
Citrus Processing Plant (Southern Gardens Citrus, Florida):
ICS for fruit receiving, juice extraction, pasteurization, packaging
Cold Storage Environmental Controls
This distributed and diverse OT footprint necessitates a tailored security approach for each operational area, considering its specific control systems, communication protocols, and risk profile, while also ensuring holistic visibility and coordinated response capabilities.
3. Digital transformation initiatives
U.S. Sugar is actively engaged in several digital transformation initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and data-driven decision-making. The most prominent of these is the enterprise-wide migration to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.18 This project is not merely an IT upgrade but a fundamental business transformation intended to integrate core business processes from finance and procurement with operational processes in agriculture and supply chain management. The goal is to achieve greater visibility, streamline operations, and leverage data analytics for improved performance.
Beyond the SAP implementation, U.S. Sugar is embracing advanced technologies in its operational domains:
Precision Agriculture: Adoption of technologies like John Deere’s Auto Field Cruise for automated tractor guidance, which saves significant amounts of fuel annually.18
Drone Technology: Partnership with Hiphen to utilize drones for sophisticated agricultural tasks such as sugarcane variety selection, estimating plant biovolume for yield predictions, and detecting and combating muck fires in the fields.18
Railroad Modernization: Testing of Network Controlled Locomotives incorporating AI and autonomous features, aiming to improve efficiency and safety in its extensive rail operations.18
Data Integration: The "2024 Report To Stockholders" highlights efforts to improve data collection from farms and factories, with the new SAP system expected to provide the latest technology for this, including embedded AI capabilities.18
These initiatives underscore the company's strategic pillar to "Embrace technology as an enabler".18 Such digital transformation efforts often create opportunities for introducing new security solutions, as new systems are deployed and existing security postures are re-evaluated. However, they also introduce new complexities and risks that must be proactively managed to ensure the transformations deliver their intended benefits securely.
Information Gap: While the SAP project and specific OT modernizations are highlighted, comprehensive details on broader technology modernization roadmaps, the existence of dedicated innovation labs or centers (though sugarcane variety research is a long-standing innovative effort 7), or other pilot programs and strategic technology partnerships are not extensively covered in the available information.
4. Infrastructure challenges
U.S. Sugar has faced and addressed infrastructure challenges historically, and new ones emerge with its ongoing transformation and expansion.
Historical Challenges (Railroad): The company's private railroad, a critical asset, previously encountered significant maintenance and operational challenges. Issues included a reactive maintenance philosophy ("maintenance by quantity, not quality"), excessive expenditures, high mechanical failure rates in the locomotive fleet, and non-compliance with Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) standards, leading to a directive to withdraw its renewal application.38 This situation necessitated a complete overhaul of its maintenance culture and strategy. U.S. Sugar partnered with Life Cycle Engineering to implement Reliability Excellence, which involved introducing preventive maintenance, planned work activities, SAP software skills training for the mechanical department, kitting, and metrics-based tracking. These efforts successfully transformed the railroad operations, achieving 100% FRA compliance, reducing the annual operating budget by 34%, and improving fleet reliability, which in turn supported record grind rates at the cane factories.38 This historical example demonstrates a willingness to invest in significant operational improvements when faced with critical infrastructure challenges.
Current and Implied Challenges:
Integration of Acquired Assets: A primary current challenge is the integration of Imperial Sugar's assets, including its IT and OT systems. The Savannah refinery, for instance, utilized a PeopleSoft ERP system 51, which differs from U.S. Sugar's SAP-centric environment. Integrating these disparate systems, ensuring data consistency, and harmonizing operational processes and security protocols across formerly separate entities is a complex undertaking.
Legacy System Management: Alongside the SAP modernization, U.S. Sugar must manage and secure remaining legacy systems, which often carry inherent security vulnerabilities and may lack modern security features.
Securing the New SAP Environment: While SAP S/4HANA offers advanced capabilities, its implementation and ongoing management require robust security measures to protect sensitive financial, operational, and agricultural data, especially in a cloud-connected model. Managing access controls (as evidenced by the Pathlock implementation 51) is a key aspect of this.
Environmental and Market Volatility: The company's infrastructure must be resilient to external challenges such as hurricanes, frosts, and floods, which can impact both agricultural production and physical facilities.18 Secure and reliable monitoring and control systems are essential for mitigating these risks.
OT Security in Converged Environments: As OT and IT systems become more interconnected through initiatives like the SAP integration of agricultural data, protecting OT environments from cyber threats that could propagate from IT networks becomes a more pressing challenge.
Addressing these infrastructure challenges, particularly those related to system integration and securing new digital platforms, is crucial for U.S. Sugar to realize the full benefits of its strategic investments in modernization and expansion.

Part I: Organization Profile & Leadership Report
Executive Summary
United States Sugar Corporation (U.S. Sugar) stands as a significant, privately-held agribusiness with deep roots in American agriculture, specializing primarily in sugarcane cultivation and processing, alongside substantial operations in citrus and sweet corn. Founded in 1931, the company is headquartered in Clewiston, Florida, and commands a considerable operational footprint, including extensive land holdings in Florida and, following a major recent acquisition, refining and processing facilities in Georgia and Kentucky.
Key organizational characteristics include its long operational history, a complex ownership structure dominated by an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and charitable foundations established by its founder, Charles Stewart Mott, and a strategic focus on vertical integration, encompassing farming, milling, refining, and its own rail transportation network. This structure influences its governance and strategic priorities, potentially balancing profit motives with employee welfare and philanthropic considerations.
The leadership team, currently headed by President and CEO Kenneth W. McDuffie (appointed October 2023), reflects a blend of long-tenured executives with deep operational expertise and newer appointments, indicative of both continuity and strategic evolution. Recent significant developments, most notably the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company (closed November 2022) and a major upgrade to its enterprise resource planning system with SAP S/4HANA (ongoing in 2024), signal a period of substantial transformation and expansion. These initiatives are aimed at enhancing efficiency, modernizing operations, and strengthening its market position.
Competitively, U.S. Sugar is the largest sugarcane producer in the United States and a major player in the refined sugar market, especially following the Imperial Sugar acquisition. It competes with other large agricultural conglomerates and sugar refiners. The company’s strategic direction emphasizes leveraging technology, maintaining low-cost production of high-quality sugar, and a continued commitment to sustainability and community engagement. These factors, combined with its complex operational and technological landscape, present unique considerations for market engagement.
Organizational Profile
1. Full legal name and corporate structure
The full legal name of the organization is United States Sugar Corporation.1 It operates as a privately owned agricultural business.1 IBISWorld further categorizes its company type as "Other".1 This private status is a critical determinant in its operational and financial transparency, limiting the availability of public data and potentially shaping its decision-making processes and investment horizons differently from publicly traded entities. The "Other" classification, in conjunction with its private nature, points towards a unique or non-standard corporate setup. This is largely attributable to its distinctive ownership composition, which includes a significant Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) and substantial holdings by philanthropic foundations.2 Such a structure suggests a governance model that may not align with typical publicly traded companies or purely family-owned private firms, potentially involving a broader array of stakeholder interests or unique approval pathways for significant capital expenditures. Decision-making processes might therefore balance profit generation with considerations for employee welfare, driven by the ESOP, and broader philanthropic objectives, influenced by the foundations.
2. Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
United States Sugar Corporation was founded in 1931.2 Its corporate headquarters is located in Clewiston, Florida, which has been its operational hub since its inception.2
The company's operations are geographically extensive. Its agricultural activities span over 230,000 to 245,000 acres in several Florida counties, including Hendry, Glades, Martin, Palm Beach, and Highlands.2 The primary sugar mill and refinery are situated in Clewiston, Florida.7 A significant expansion of its operational footprint occurred with the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company, which added a refinery at Port Wentworth, Savannah, Georgia, and a sugar transfer and liquification facility in Ludlow, Kentucky, to its assets.8 The long history of the company suggests well-established, potentially deeply ingrained operational processes and the possibility of legacy systems within its infrastructure. The acquisition of Imperial Sugar's geographically dispersed assets in Georgia and Kentucky represents a notable strategic move, extending U.S. Sugar's operational reach far beyond its historical Florida base. This expansion likely introduces considerable IT and OT integration challenges, as disparate systems and cultures from the acquired entity must be harmonized with U.S. Sugar's existing infrastructure. Furthermore, operating in new states may expose the company to different regulatory environments and an expanded cybersecurity attack surface, requiring a comprehensive approach to managing risks across a more distributed enterprise. Imperial Sugar's historical sourcing of raw sugar from Central and South America and the Caribbean also introduces additional supply chain complexities that may carry cybersecurity implications.9
3. Organizational history and key milestones
United States Sugar Corporation was established in 1931 when industrialist and philanthropist Charles Stewart Mott acquired the assets of the bankrupt Southern Sugar Company near Clewiston, Florida.2 Throughout its history, the company has navigated periods of significant growth, diversification, technological upgrades, and structural changes.
Key milestones that have shaped the organization include:
1940s: The company faced charges related to slavery violations, a sensitive historical point that may inform contemporary perceptions of its corporate social responsibility.2
1962: Opening of the Bryant Sugar House, which at the time was the world's largest and most modern sugarcane processing mill.2 This facility was later closed in 2007, with operations consolidated to the Clewiston mill as part of efficiency measures.10 This consolidation demonstrates a strategic focus on operational efficiency and modernization, even when requiring difficult business decisions. Such pragmatism suggests that business cases for cybersecurity emphasizing ROI, operational resilience, and efficiency gains would likely resonate.
1970s: Under the leadership of C.S. Harding Mott, son of the founder, U.S. Sugar diversified its agricultural portfolio to include cattle, citrus, and vegetables.2
1980: Acquisition of South Bay Growers, further expanding its vegetable operations.2
1983: Formation of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) as part of a strategy to take the company private.2
1990s: U.S. Sugar became the first fully integrated refinery in the nation with the addition of the Clewiston Refinery, enabling complete processing from field to consumer.7
2002: The Clewiston refinery was expanded to include liquid sugar capabilities, and its subsidiary, Southern Gardens Citrus, acquired Alcoma Groves, increasing its citrus acreage.7
2008: The Clewiston milling and refining facility was recognized as the world’s largest vertically integrated sugarcane milling and refining facility.7
2021-2022: A landmark development was the acquisition of Imperial Sugar Company from Louis Dreyfus Company, a move that significantly increased U.S. Sugar's refining capacity and market presence.9
October 2023: Kenneth W. McDuffie was appointed President and CEO, marking a significant leadership transition.15
2024 (Ongoing): Announcement and implementation of a major upgrade to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, representing a substantial technological transformation.17
This consistent pattern of investment in operational capacity and technology, such as the SAP upgrade, suggests a corporate culture that, despite its long history, values modernization and is willing to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitiveness and efficiency. This historical behavior could indicate a similar preparedness to invest in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and services, particularly if a clear business case for risk mitigation and protection of these substantial investments is presented. The SAP S/4HANA project, being a major digital transformation, creates an opportune moment to address cybersecurity comprehensively.
4. Industry classification and primary business activities
U.S. Sugar Corporation's primary business activities are centered on agriculture and food production. It is recognized as the largest producer of sugarcane in the United States.2 Beyond sugarcane, the company also produces refined sugar, sweet corn, and oranges.2 A key operational feature is its ownership and operation of an internal rail system, the South Central Florida Express, for transporting its agricultural products.7 The company describes itself as a fully integrated producer of sugarcane, one of Florida's major producers of orange juice products (through its Southern Gardens Citrus division), and a regional short-line railroad operator.19 Its product portfolio includes raw inputs like seeds, intermediate products like bagasse and milled sugar, and finished products like refined sugar.1
The company operates within the Agricultural industry 2 and the Food & Beverage sector.20 Specific industry classifications include:
NAICS Codes:
111 - Crop Production 21
111930 - Sugarcane Farming (also cited as 11193 - Sugarcane Harvesting) 1
Potentially 31131 - Sugar Manufacturing (covering refining activities)
SIC Codes:
0133 - Sugarcane and Sugar Beets 22
2061 - Cane Sugar, Except Refining 23
2062 - Cane Sugar Refining 23
The vertical integration of U.S. Sugar—encompassing sugarcane farming, extensive processing and refining operations, and its own railroad for transport—creates a highly interconnected and complex operational environment.7 While this integration offers significant efficiencies and control over the supply chain, it also means that a cyber incident in one segment of the value chain could have cascading disruptive effects on other operations. For instance, an OT security incident affecting the railroad could halt sugarcane transport to the mills, or an attack on industrial control systems in processing plants could lead to production stoppages or spoilage of raw materials, ultimately resulting in substantial financial losses. This interconnectedness, further emphasized by the integrating nature of the SAP S/4HANA upgrade 18, underscores the critical need for a holistic security strategy that addresses both IT and OT environments.
5. Precise company size metrics
Annual Revenue:
Precise, recent, consolidated annual revenue figures for U.S. Sugar, especially after the Imperial Sugar acquisition, are not publicly available due to its private status.
Older estimates from 2008 placed U.S. Sugar's annual revenue in the range of approximately $604 million to $657.5 million, with breakdowns for sugar, citrus, and rail operations.24
More recent contextual data from a November 2021 Department of Justice press release (referring to 2020 figures) indicated that U.S. Sugar received payments of $533 million from the United Sugars cooperative, its marketing arm.26 The same release noted that Imperial Sugar's revenues were over $700 million in 2020.26
The acquisition of Imperial Sugar, a company with 2020 revenues comparable to or exceeding U.S. Sugar's own pre-acquisition indicators, strongly suggests that U.S. Sugar's current total revenue substantially exceeds $1 billion annually. This rapid expansion in operational scale and market presence, effectively doubling the company's size, creates immense pressure for integrating systems, processes, and security postures across the newly combined entity. This level of integration complexity is a significant risk factor that comprehensive cybersecurity services can help mitigate, ensuring that the expanded operations are secure and resilient.
Competitor revenues further support this scale: Florida Crystals Corporation reported 2024 revenues cited between $562 million (LeadIQ) and $1.6 billion (industry blog), and American Crystal Sugar Company's 2024 revenues were cited between $411.3 million (Growjo) and $931.8 million (industry blog).27
Information Gap: A precise current annual revenue figure and a 3-year trend for the combined U.S. Sugar and Imperial Sugar entity are not publicly available.
Employee Count:
Estimates for U.S. Sugar's employee count consistently range from 2,500 to 3,000 individuals.1 This represents a significant workforce for a privately held agribusiness.
Market Capitalization:
As a privately held company, U.S. Sugar is not publicly traded and therefore does not have a market capitalization.1 Its valuation would be determined by private assessments, which would likely be substantial given its extensive assets, market position, and revenue scale.
Growth Rate and Financial Trajectory:
Specific financial growth rates for U.S. Sugar are not publicly disclosed. However, the strategic acquisition of Imperial Sugar implies a significant step-change in growth and market presence. The company's "2024 Report To Stockholders" indicated that the 2023-2024 sugarcane crop was the third largest in its history, and the Clewiston Refinery operated ahead of budget, suggesting positive operational performance and likely revenue growth.18
The broader U.S. sugar market has seen price fluctuations and varied production forecasts.31 While some analysts project strong growth for the U.S. sugar market 34, others indicate more modest expansion.35 USDA forecasts for the U.S. 2025/26 sugar supply indicate a potential lowering compared to the prior year, while global production is projected to increase.32
Information Gap: Specific financial growth rates and a detailed financial trajectory for U.S. Sugar are not publicly available.
6. Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
U.S. Sugar's operational headquarters remains in Clewiston, Florida.2 Its agricultural land holdings are concentrated in South and Central Florida, encompassing 230,000 to 245,000 acres across Hendry, Glades, Martin, Palm Beach, and Highlands counties.2
The company's key processing and logistical sites include:
Table: Key U.S. Sugar Operational Locations

Location
Type of Facility
Estimated Size/Capacity
Clewiston, FL
Vertically Integrated Sugarcane Mill & Refinery
Processes up to 42,000 tons sugarcane/day; produces ~800,000-850,000 tons sugar/year 7
Port Wentworth, Savannah, GA
Sugar Refinery (ex-Imperial Sugar)
Current capacity ~805,000 short tons/year; planned expansion to 875,000 short tons/year 8
Ludlow, KY
Sugar Transfer & Liquification (ex-Imperial Sugar)
Serves as a key logistical hub 8
Florida (various locations)
Citrus Groves & Processing Plant (Southern Gardens)
Over 30,000 acres of citrus groves; processing plant with 120 million gallons/year juice capacity 7
South & Central Florida
Railroad System (South Central Florida Express)
Over 120 miles of track; 14 locomotives, ~1,000 railcars 12
Florida (various locations)
Vegetable Farming (Rouge River Farms)
Significant acreage for sweet corn and green beans 16

This expanded geographic footprint, particularly with the integration of the Imperial Sugar facilities, increases logistical complexity and underscores the need for secure, interconnected systems for communication and operational control across diverse locations. Each major facility represents a critical node within the company's broader IT and OT network.
7. Detailed corporate structure
Parent-Subsidiary Relationships: United States Sugar Corporation is the principal entity. Key subsidiaries or operating divisions include Southern Gardens Citrus (focused on citrus products) 2 and, following its acquisition, Imperial Sugar Company (encompassing its refining assets and consumer brands).9
Business Units and Divisions: The company operates through several distinct business units:
Sugarcane Farming and Raw Sugar Production
Sugar Refining (Clewiston and Savannah facilities, including Imperial Sugar brands like Imperial®, Dixie Crystals®, White Gold®, and Holly Sugar® 8)
Citrus Operations (Southern Gardens Citrus)
Vegetable Farming (Rouge River Farms) 16
Railroad Operations (South Central Florida Express) 19
Next Generation Energy (utilizing bagasse for biofuel) 18
An Industrial Skills Training Academy (ISTA) is also part of its structure, focused on talent development.18 Each of these units possesses unique operational characteristics and technological requirements, particularly concerning OT security. The acquisition of Imperial Sugar's brands significantly expands U.S. Sugar's product portfolio and market reach, especially in consumer-facing segments. This diversification into more prominent consumer brands may heighten the company's sensitivity to reputational damage arising from cyber incidents, such as data breaches or production disruptions that affect brand availability and consumer trust. A security incident affecting production or the supply chain for these brands could lead to empty shelves or product recalls, directly impacting consumer perception and loyalty beyond the immediate financial costs.
Recent Restructuring Initiatives: The most significant recent restructuring initiative is the ongoing acquisition and integration of Imperial Sugar Company.9 This involves incorporating Imperial's Port Wentworth refinery and Ludlow facility into U.S. Sugar's operational framework. A major component of this is the $35.65 million multi-year Centrifuge Improvement Project at the Savannah refinery, aimed at modernizing and expanding its capabilities.18 Concurrently, the company-wide upgrade to SAP S/4HANA represents a fundamental business process and IT restructuring effort, designed to enhance efficiency and data management across the consolidated enterprise.17 These large-scale initiatives create both operational risks during the transition phases and strategic opportunities for implementing new, robust security solutions.
Merger and Acquisition History:
1980: Acquired South Bay Growers, expanding into vegetable production.2 (Note: Most of South Bay Growers was subsequently closed in 1994 2).
March 2021 - November 2022: Announced the agreement to acquire Imperial Sugar Company from Louis Dreyfus Company for approximately $315 million (later adjusted to $297 million).8 The deal faced an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice but was ultimately allowed to proceed, closing in November 2022.14 This acquisition is the most impactful M&A activity in recent history and is central to understanding U.S. Sugar's current strategic posture and operational needs.
8. Ownership structure
Public Trading Information: United States Sugar Corporation is a privately held company and is not publicly traded on any stock exchange.1
Private Equity Ownership Details: The company has a unique ownership structure. It is primarily owned by its employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), which holds an estimated 40% stake.2 Significant ownership is also held by charitable foundations established by the founder, Charles Stewart Mott. These include The C.S. Mott Foundation (approximately 19%) and The Mott Children's Health Center (approximately 22%).2 The Community Foundation of Greater Flint also holds a smaller stake (approximately 6%).2 This complex stakeholder environment, particularly the substantial ownership by philanthropic foundations and the ESOP, likely influences corporate strategy. The Mott Foundation's focus on areas such as environmental stewardship and community well-being 4 may mean that U.S. Sugar is more receptive to arguments for cybersecurity investments that are framed around long-term sustainability, protection of critical food infrastructure, community impact (e.g., job protection through operational resilience), and responsible business practices, rather than solely on short-term financial ROI. The direct link is further solidified by Ridgway H. White, President and CEO of the Mott Foundation, also serving as Chairman of U.S. Sugar's Board of Directors.39 This dual role suggests that cybersecurity proposals emphasizing resilience, protection of critical food infrastructure, and long-term business sustainability would likely resonate at the board level, aligning with the foundation's broader goals and the ESOP's interest in company longevity.
Recent Ownership Changes: There have been no fundamental changes to this core ESOP and foundation-based ownership structure in recent years. The company transitioned to private ownership in 1987 through the establishment of the ESOP.2 Historical events include past lawsuits related to ESOP share valuation.2

The composition of the Board, particularly with Ridgway H. White as Chairman while also leading The Mott Foundation (a major shareholder), underscores a strong alignment between the company's governance and the Foundation's long-term interests.4 These interests often extend beyond pure financial returns to include sustainability, community impact, and responsible corporate citizenship. Consequently, cybersecurity initiatives presented to the Board may find greater traction if they are framed not only in terms of ROI but also as measures that protect long-term shareholder value (including ESOP participants), ensure operational stability (safeguarding jobs and community well-being), and uphold the company's reputation as a responsible steward of its resources and legacy. A Chairman who also leads a significant shareholding entity, especially a philanthropic foundation with a mission focused on societal good, will likely ensure the company's strategy reflects these broader values.

Matthew Miller, Sr. Director of IT Business Solutions and Benefits: Reporting to Carl Stringer, Miller has played a crucial role in the recent SAP S/4HANA migration and the implementation of Pathlock for Segregation of Duties (SoD).51 His role suggests a focus on the secure and efficient deployment of enterprise applications and managing associated compliance and risk.
No individual with the explicit title of Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) was identified from the available information for U.S. Sugar. The absence of a dedicated CISO role, based on current public data, suggests that overall cybersecurity strategy, decision-making, and oversight may reside with the VP of IT, Carl Stringer, or could be distributed among senior IT staff like Matthew Miller, particularly concerning application security and GRC. In organizations lacking a CISO, the highest-ranking IT executive often absorbs strategic security responsibilities. Matthew Miller's role in "IT Business Solutions" and his involvement with Pathlock (an SoD/GRC tool) further suggests he handles significant aspects of application security and compliance. This organizational structure could present an opportunity for specialized cybersecurity advisory services to help define or mature the strategic security function, especially given the increased complexity following the Imperial Sugar acquisition and the SAP transformation. Alternatively, it may indicate that Mr. Stringer is a highly influential and centralized decision-maker for all security-related investments.
Information Gaps: Specific individuals in roles such as security operations leadership, dedicated compliance and risk management leadership (beyond Matthew Miller's involvement with SoD tools), or distinct digital transformation leadership (though Stringer and Miller are central to the SAP project) are not clearly identified in the publicly available information.
4. Middle management in relevant departments
Specific names or detailed roles of middle management within IT infrastructure, security operations, network and systems administration, or procurement and vendor management at U.S. Sugar are not available from the provided research materials. Identifying these individuals would typically require direct engagement or deeper internal discovery. These roles are often crucial for the practical implementation of cybersecurity solutions and can be significant influencers in technology selection processes.
Information Gap: This represents a notable information gap that would need to be addressed during the sales discovery phase to understand the operational IT and security teams and procurement processes more thoroughly.
5. Decision-making patterns
As a privately held company with a distinctive ownership structure involving an ESOP and major charitable foundations, U.S. Sugar's decision-making processes for significant investments are likely more nuanced than those of a typical publicly traded corporation. The Board of Directors, particularly Chairman Ridgway H. White (who also leads the Mott Foundation), is expected to wield considerable influence on major strategic investments that impact the company's long-term trajectory and risk posture.39
The successful execution of the Imperial Sugar acquisition, despite a DOJ challenge 14, and the ongoing large-scale SAP S/4HANA migration 18, demonstrate that the organization possesses established, albeit internal, mechanisms for evaluating, approving, and funding complex, multi-million dollar strategic initiatives. This history suggests a capacity for thorough due diligence and strategic execution. Such large-scale initiatives inherently require extensive planning, significant financial commitment, and robust cross-departmental coordination. The company's ability to navigate these complexities indicates a mature capacity for strategic decision-making.
For technology purchases, especially significant cybersecurity investments, the approval process would likely involve several key stakeholders:
IT Leadership (Carl Stringer and Matthew Miller): Would identify the technical need, vet solutions, and champion the proposal internally.
Chief Financial Officer (Elaine Wood): Would scrutinize the budgetary impact, potential ROI, and overall financial justification.
Chief Executive Officer (Kenneth W. McDuffie): Would provide final executive approval, assessing the proposal's alignment with overarching strategic priorities, operational impact, and risk mitigation benefits.
Board of Directors: For investments of a particularly large scale or those deemed strategically critical to the company's risk profile or long-term stability, Board approval would likely be necessary.
The successful navigation of large, complex projects implies that while the specific thresholds and detailed budget authorities are not public, a formal process is in place. A well-justified cybersecurity proposal that clearly articulates value, addresses tangible risks (especially those heightened by recent acquisitions and system migrations), and aligns with strategic goals such as modernization and operational efficiency is likely to receive serious consideration.
Information Gap: Specific financial approval thresholds and detailed budget authorities for technology purchases are not publicly available.

Important to note U.S. Sugar's non-involvement to avoid misattribution of this specific initiative. U.S. Sugar is pursuing its own growth strategy (e.g., Imperial acquisition).
Ongoing (2024-2025)
Fluctuations in global/US sugar prices and production forecasts by USDA, etc. 37
Market volatility underscores the need for operational efficiency and cost control, where resilient and secure systems play a key role in preventing costly disruptions.
