10. Security Breaches, Incidents, and Vulnerability Disclosures
Exxon Mobil, like any large organization, faces ongoing security challenges. Publicly available information provides some insights into past security breaches, incidents, and external assessments of its vulnerability landscape 69.
10.1. Publicly Documented Security Breaches and Incidents
In 2012, the hacktivist group Anonymous claimed to have targeted ExxonMobil as part of "Op SaveTheArctic," alleging a compromise of company data and the leakage of email addresses and hashed passwords 70. The attack was reportedly in response to environmental concerns, and ExxonMobil did not comment on the security-related inquiries at the time. The breach was believed to have occurred on a smaller web server and involved a limited number of accounts.
A security breach occurred at ExxonMobil's plant in Baytown, Texas, in April 2016, when an unauthorized individual entered the complex, leading to a temporary lockdown 71. Authorities responded to the incident, but no arrests were reported. ExxonMobil stated that they take such matters seriously and were working closely with law enforcement. This incident appears to be a physical security breach rather than a cyber security event.
In 2024, reports emerged that DCI Group, a lobbying firm that had worked with ExxonMobil, was under investigation by the FBI for its alleged involvement in the "Dark Basin" spear phishing operation 72. This operation targeted thousands of individuals and organizations globally, including environmental advocacy groups. ExxonMobil reportedly ended its contract with DCI in 2020 after the hacking investigation became public. While ExxonMobil was not directly implicated in initiating the hacking, there were allegations that the corporation used information obtained through the operation.
10.2. Analysis of External Security Posture Assessments
UpGuard, a security ratings service, continuously monitors the security posture of ExxonMobil using open-source and proprietary threat intelligence feeds 69. Their analysis results in a security rating, with ExxonMobil receiving a rating of "B," indicating a generally good security posture based on their external attack surface 69. The UpGuard reports also highlight specific findings across various risk categories.
In terms of website security, UpGuard noted that server information headers and ASP.NET version headers were not exposed, which is a good security practice 69. The website's Referrer Policy was also configured appropriately 69. However, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) was not enforced, which could make users more susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks 69.
Regarding email security, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) was strictly enforced, which helps prevent email spoofing 69. A DKIM record was found, but the DMARC policy was not set to quarantine or reject, suggesting an area for potential improvement in preventing email-based attacks 69.
For network security, no open ports were detected, which is a positive finding 69. However, DNSSEC was not enabled, and a CAA record was not present, which could leave the domain more vulnerable to certain types of attacks 69.
In the area of encryption, SSL was supported, and HTTP requests were redirected to HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication 69. The SSL certificate was valid, trusted, and used a strong algorithm and key length 69. Weak cipher suites were supported in TLS 1.2, which could potentially be exploited by well-resourced attackers 69.
UpGuard's IP/Domain Reputation analysis indicated no recent reports of botnet activity, brute force login attempts, or phishing activity associated with ExxonMobil's domains 69. However, there were some reports of malware distribution in the preceding 90 days 69.
Finally, the vulnerability management assessment showed that ExxonMobil's servers were not vulnerable to several known exploits like Heartbleed, POODLE, FREAK, and Logjam 69.
10.3. Key Takeaways
ExxonMobil has been the target of hacktivist activity and experienced a physical security incident. An external lobbying firm associated with the company was also under investigation for cyber espionage. External security assessments indicate a generally good security posture, but areas for improvement exist, particularly in enabling DNSSEC and HSTS and strengthening email authentication protocols.
10.4. Second/Third-Order Insights
The hacktivist attack highlights the need for energy companies to be vigilant against ideologically motivated cyber threats, in addition to traditional criminal and state-sponsored actors. The investigation into the lobbying firm underscores the importance of third-party risk management in cybersecurity. The vulnerabilities identified in the external security assessments, while not critical, represent potential areas of exposure that ExxonMobil should address to further enhance its security posture. Continuous monitoring and remediation of these types of vulnerabilities are essential for maintaining a strong defense against evolving cyber threats.
