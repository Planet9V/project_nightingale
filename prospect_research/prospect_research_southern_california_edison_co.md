Go-to-Market Analysis: Southern California Edison Company
Executive Summary
Southern California Edison (SCE), a prominent investor-owned public utility and a key subsidiary of Edison International (NYSE: EIX), delivers electricity to approximately 15 million individuals across a vast 50,000 square-mile service area in central, coastal, and Southern California.1 The organization, with roots dating back to 1886 and officially incorporated as SCE in 1909, is headquartered in Rosemead, California, and maintains a significant operational footprint across its service territory.3
Leadership is anchored by Pedro J. Pizarro, President and CEO of Edison International, and Steven D. Powell, President and CEO of SCE.4 Key technology and security functions are overseen by Todd L. Inlander, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, and Brian Barrios, Vice President and Chief Security Officer.7
Recent strategic developments underscore SCE's commitment to substantial investments in wildfire mitigation, grid hardening, and the clean energy transition, exemplified by a major NextGen ERP program.9 The company has also navigated significant legal settlements stemming from past wildfires, which continue to shape its operational and financial priorities.12 Within the competitive landscape, SCE stands as one of California's three dominant investor-owned utilities, collectively accounting for approximately 68% of the state's electric retail sales.13
Organizational Profile
Southern California Edison Company operates as a crucial component within the broader corporate structure of Edison International. Edison International, a public utility holding company incorporated in 1987, serves as the parent entity, publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker EIX.1 SCE, a California public utility incorporated in 1909, constitutes Edison International's primary subsidiary and is dedicated to the supply and delivery of electricity across its extensive service area.1 Beyond its core utility operations, Edison International also owns Edison Energy Group, which operates as Trio Group, a global energy advisory firm specializing in integrated sustainability and energy solutions for commercial, industrial, and institutional clients.1
The historical trajectory of SCE traces back to 1886 with the founding of Holt & Knupps in Visalia, California, a predecessor company involved in providing street lighting.3 The formal incorporation of Southern California Edison Company occurred in 1909, following a series of mergers and acquisitions of smaller electric power companies throughout the region.5 A pivotal milestone in 1917 saw SCE acquire its largest remaining competitor, Pacific Light and Power, solidifying its regional dominance.17 The company's headquarters moved to Rosemead, California, in 1971, where it remains today.3 In 1988, a corporate restructuring led to the formation of SCEcorp, later renamed Edison International, and the establishment of an unregulated power generation entity, Edison Mission Energy. This strategic shift aimed to position the company for industry deregulation and increased competition.4 More recently, SCE faced significant challenges and litigation stemming from its equipment being linked to major wildfires in 2017 and 2018, such as the Thomas Fire and Woolsey Fire, resulting in substantial legal and financial implications.12 In response, the company has increasingly focused on investments in renewable energy, grid modernization, and wildfire mitigation efforts.5
SCE's primary business activities fall under the Public Utility industry classification.4 Its operations are categorized under NAICS code 22 (Utilities), specifically 221118 (Other Electric Power Generation), and SIC code 4931 (Electric services), specifically 49110000 (Electric services).3 The core function of SCE involves supplying and delivering electricity to approximately 5 million customers across a 50,000 square-mile service area, encompassing over 180 incorporated cities and 15 counties in central, coastal, and Southern California, excluding the City of Los Angeles and some other municipalities.1 This encompasses the full spectrum of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.16 Meanwhile, Edison Energy Group (Trio) extends the company's reach into global energy advisory services, providing integrated sustainability and energy solutions to large commercial, industrial, and institutional clients.1
Financially, Edison International reported annual revenues of $17.599 billion in 2024, representing a 7.72% increase from 2023. This followed a 5.12% decline in 2023 revenue to $16.338 billion from $17.22 billion in 2022, which itself was a 15.53% increase from $14.905 billion in 2021.20 As of May 2, 2025, Edison International's market capitalization stood at $21.12 billion.21 The company reported core earnings of $1.9 billion in 2024, with a stated confidence in achieving a 5-7% core EPS growth from $5.84 in 2025 to $6.74-$7.14 by 2028.2 The workforce numbered 14,013 employees in 2024, though another source indicated 15,935 employees with a 2% growth in the preceding year.2 The slight discrepancy in employee count may be attributed to varying reporting periods or inclusion criteria. The overall financial trajectory demonstrates a stable, regulated utility focused on consistent, long-term growth in core earnings, with significant capital expenditures often tied to regulatory approvals and long-term strategic plans.
SCE's geographic footprint covers approximately 50,000 square miles across central, coastal, and Southern California, serving 15 million people.5 Its extensive infrastructure includes 125,000 miles of distribution and bulk transmission lines, supported by 1.3 million distribution structures, 1.4 million electric poles, and 142,000 transmission structures.5 By the end of 2022, SCE maintained one of the nation's largest energy storage portfolios, exceeding 5,000 megawatts, and delivered 45% carbon-free power to its customers, a figure 48% cleaner than the national average.24 Operational locations span numerous cities, including major facilities and substations in Fullerton, Chino, Oxnard, Ontario, Redlands, Irwindale, and Rosemead.3
The corporate structure is characterized by Edison International as the parent holding company, with Southern California Edison and Edison Energy Group as its primary subsidiaries.1 SCE itself maintains several utility subsidiaries, such as Edison Material Supply LLC for procurement and warehousing, and EDISON WILDFIRE INSURANCE, INC. for self-insurance against wildfire liabilities. Inactive financing vehicles, like SCE Trust II-XI, are also part of its structure. Edison Energy Group, operating as Trio, oversees numerous non-utility subsidiaries engaged in diverse energy solutions, consulting, and renewable energy projects, including Alfa Energy Limited and Altenex Energy.15 Recent restructuring initiatives primarily involve the rebranding and reclassification of entities within Edison Energy Group, reflecting a dynamic and evolving strategy in the unregulated energy solutions market.15 This ongoing adaptation suggests a focus on market responsiveness and a willingness to explore new business models. For external partners, understanding the specific entity within Edison International is crucial, as the needs and regulatory environments of the utility and unregulated advisory arms differ significantly. Historically, SCE was formed through the aggregation of numerous smaller electric power companies and acquired Pacific Light and Power in 1917.5 The company was also involved in the sale of most of Edison Mission Energy's assets in 2014.26
The ownership structure of Edison International (EIX) is predominantly institutional, with approximately 71.72% of the company's stock held by institutional investors.27 Major institutional shareholders include Vanguard (11.52%), Vanguard Index Funds (9.69%), iShares (7.59%), and SPDR (6.40%).27 A smaller portion, 0.16%, is owned by insiders, while 28.13% is held by public companies and individual investors.27 For Southern California Edison Co. (US:US842400GN73), Six Circles Ultra Short Duration Fund is noted as an institutional owner holding 7,905,000 shares.28 The substantial institutional ownership indicates a strong emphasis on consistent financial performance, robust risk management, and adherence to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. This aligns with SCE's significant investments in wildfire mitigation and its clean energy transition, as these initiatives directly impact long-term financial stability and investor confidence.

Decision-Making Patterns:
Organizational decision-making appears highly centralized and structured, particularly for critical technology and safety initiatives. Major capital investments and IT/OT modernization efforts, such as the NextGen ERP program, require California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approval.10 The NextGen ERP program, for instance, is seeking $1.162 billion from ratepayers and is subject to CPUC approval, indicating a rigorous external approval process for significant technology purchases.10 Procurement decisions are based on value (cost, quality, service) and are closely monitored by regulatory agencies like the CPUC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).57 Internal financial approvals for projects are managed by the Capital Review Team (CRT) and Financial Risk Management Committee (FRM), which oversee capital expenditures and program blankets.59 This layered approval process underscores a strong emphasis on financial prudence and regulatory compliance in all major investment decisions.
The overarching focus on wildfire risk, regulatory compliance, and cybersecurity is deeply embedded at the executive level. The ongoing and costly wildfire litigation, including direct shareholder lawsuits against executives for alleged mismanagement, places immense pressure on SCE's leadership to visibly and effectively mitigate wildfire risk.12 This pressure directly translates into accelerated and substantial capital investments in operational technologies and related cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents and reduce financial and legal liabilities. The Board's direct oversight of cybersecurity through its Safety and Operations Committee further emphasizes this critical link.61 Therefore, any cybersecurity solution, particularly those focused on OT security, must explicitly connect to mitigating wildfire risk, ensuring regulatory compliance (e.g., NERC CIP, CPUC mandates), and protecting the company's financial stability and public image. This positions cybersecurity as a direct enabler of public safety and financial de-risking, rather than merely an IT cost.
The strategic importance of digital transformation and ERP modernization for operational efficiency and grid resilience is also a key driver. The NextGen ERP program, a multi-year initiative with a budget of approximately $1.4 billion, is not merely an IT upgrade but a foundational element of SCE's broader digital transformation and grid modernization strategy.10 This program aims to streamline operations, enhance data accuracy, and enable integrated, enterprise-wide decision-making, all critical for managing a complex, evolving grid and achieving clean energy goals.52 Robust security and data integrity are essential to realize the benefits of this new ERP system. Therefore, enterprise security, data protection, and IT/OT convergence solutions can be positioned as critical enablers for the success of this multi-year, multi-billion dollar transformation, demonstrating how they support the agility and integration goals of the ERP.

July 2024 - July 2025: SCE is undertaking infrastructure upgrades in Santa Monica, demonstrating ongoing localized grid improvements.68
Strategic Initiatives:
SCE's strategic direction is heavily influenced by California's aggressive climate goals and the persistent challenge of wildfire risk. The company's "Pathway 2045" is a data-driven analysis outlining the comprehensive transformation required for California to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.69 This includes ambitious targets such as 100% carbon-free retail electricity, 26 million electric vehicles (EVs), 1 million+ electrified medium and heavy-duty vehicles, and 70% electrified buildings.69 Complementing this, Edison International published "Reaching Net Zero: Accelerating California's Clean Energy Transition" (2024) and "Countdown to 2045" (2023), detailing the necessary steps for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.70 The "Adapting for Tomorrow" (2022) report shares findings from SCE's Climate Adaptation Vulnerability Assessment, advocating for increased collaboration between public and private stakeholders to facilitate an equitable clean energy transition.70
A core component of this strategy is SCE's 10-year Grid Modernization vision, which aims to create a safer, cleaner, more reliable, more resilient, and more efficient grid capable of integrating new customer technologies.71 Executive statements, such as those from CEO Pedro Pizarro, consistently emphasize investments in system hardening and wildfire mitigation for community safety.22 Steven Powell, President of SCE, highlights the commitment to building a resilient grid and exploring advanced technologies.9 Todd Inlander, CIO, further articulates the role of AI and digital tools in enhancing grid reliability and accelerating electrification.72 Investor presentations reinforce these priorities, detailing capital expenditures, rate base growth, and financial outlook, while also acknowledging risks related to cybersecurity and the physical security of assets.30 Annual reports prioritize clean energy transition, electrification, workforce development, and public safety.70
Organizational Changes:
Recent organizational changes at the leadership level include the appointment of Jennifer M. Granholm to the Board of Directors in 2025 34, while Adam S. Umanoff, EVP and General Counsel, announced his retirement effective July 4, 2025.35 The passing of former Chairman and CEO John Bryson in May 2025 also marked a notable change in the company's historical leadership.16 Beyond these leadership shifts, no major corporate-level restructuring has been publicly announced, with the focus instead on the ongoing evolution and adaptation of Edison Energy Group's subsidiaries to market demands.15
Financial Developments:
SCE has been active in capital markets to support its extensive investment plans. In May 2024, SCE issued $750 million in 5.45% First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds, due 2031, with interest accruing from May 9, 2024.73 Major anticipated investments include $6.2 billion over three years (2026-2028) for the Wildfire Mitigation Plan 11 and approximately $5 billion annually for broader grid upgrades.74 The NextGen ERP program alone represents a substantial capital expenditure of approximately $1.4 billion over five years.62 While specific cost-cutting initiatives are not extensively detailed, the company emphasizes "cost-effective technology solutions" 7 and "keeping costs affordable for customers".70 The June 1, 2025, residential rate decrease, partly due to the removal of fully recovered costs from rates, reflects ongoing efforts to manage customer costs.64 No explicit changes in financial reporting structure were noted, with core earnings consistently used for internal planning and investor communications.1
Analysis of Strategic Trajectory and Implications for Technology and Security Priorities:
SCE's strategic trajectory is profoundly shaped by the dual pressures of California's ambitious clean energy mandates and the escalating threat of wildfires. The company is committing multi-billion dollar investments to transform its grid and meet decarbonization goals, all within a highly regulated environment where cost recovery is subject to CPUC approval.10
The persistent and costly wildfire litigation, including direct shareholder lawsuits against executives, has created an intense imperative for SCE leadership to visibly and effectively mitigate wildfire risk.12 This pressure directly translates into accelerated and substantial capital investments in operational technologies and related cybersecurity to prevent future incidents and reduce financial and legal liabilities. The technologies being deployed, such as AI/ML for inspections, covered conductors, undergrounding, early fault detection, and Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiters (REFCL), are not merely upgrades; they are direct responses to a severe, ongoing business threat.9 This indicates that cybersecurity solutions must be framed not just as technical improvements, but as direct contributors to legal risk reduction, financial stability, and the restoration of public trust.
Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny and compliance serve as a primary driver for technology adoption and security maturity. Operating in a highly regulated environment means that large-scale initiatives like the NextGen ERP and wildfire mitigation plans must be justified not only by their business value but also by their alignment with regulatory mandates and public safety requirements.10 SCE's explicit commitment to compliance with frameworks like NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and NERC CIP standards underscores this.78 Therefore, any technology or security offering must demonstrate how it helps SCE meet or exceed these regulatory requirements, providing "regulatory certainty" and "compliance benefits" that resonate with legal, risk, and finance departments.
The strategic emphasis on grid modernization and electrification necessitates significant IT/OT investments. This drives demand for advanced analytics, AI, and secure communication systems to support distributed energy resources (DERs), EV charging infrastructure, and smart buildings.58 The NextGen ERP modernization is a foundational IT initiative designed to improve operational efficiency and data quality, which underpins all other strategic goals.10 Ensuring robust enterprise security and data protection for this multi-year, multi-billion dollar ERP transformation is critical for its success.

High-Level OT Environment Map (Conceptual)
SCE's Operational Technology (OT) environment is a sprawling network of interconnected systems and devices essential for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. At its core are SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems 7, which provide centralized control and monitoring over geographically dispersed assets like substations, power plants, and distribution networks. These SCADA systems interact with a multitude of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) that directly manage physical processes and equipment.113
The environment is increasingly characterized by the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including customer-owned solar panels, battery storage systems, and electric vehicles (EVs).74 These DERs communicate with the grid through various protocols, including IEEE 2030.5 and DNP 3.0, managed by systems like the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS).113
Network connectivity within the OT environment relies on an expansive fiber optic network and a transitioning low-latency, high-speed wireless field area network (FAN).71 Critical communications for field crews are supported by radio systems.115
IT/OT convergence is a strategic imperative, with efforts to modernize and integrate these traditionally separate domains to improve efficiency, security, and resilience.58 This convergence introduces new complexities, as IT systems (e.g., ERP, cloud platforms) increasingly interact with OT systems for data analysis, predictive maintenance, and remote control. For instance, AI-driven platforms for network operations (Project Orca) bridge the IT and telecommunications networks to enhance operational efficiency.110 However, this convergence also expands the attack surface, as demonstrated by the focus on securing "IT and OT systems running on the same network".126
Key components and integration points include:
Centralized Control: SCADA systems overseeing power generation, transmission, and distribution.
Grid Edge Devices: Smart meters, IoT sensors (e.g., for energy optimization in buildings), EV charging stations, and DERs (solar, battery storage).90
Communication Networks: Fiber optics, wireless FAN, and radio systems enabling data flow between IT and OT, and across the grid.71
Data Integration: Real-time data from OT systems is fed into IT platforms for advanced analytics, AI-driven insights (e.g., wildfire cameras), and enterprise-wide decision-making (e.g., NextGen ERP).11
Physical Infrastructure: Substations, power lines (including covered conductor and undergrounding), poles, and other physical assets that are monitored and controlled by OT systems.5
This environment is characterized by a mix of legacy industrial control systems with long lifespans and newer, more digitally-enabled devices, creating a complex security challenge at the intersection of traditional physical controls and modern cyber threats.
