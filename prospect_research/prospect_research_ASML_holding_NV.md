1. Organizational Profile
1.1. Full legal name and corporate structure
The full legal name of the company is ASML Holding N.V..2 It is structured as a public limited liability company (Naamloze Vennootschap) incorporated and operating under the laws of the Netherlands. This legal status carries implications for its corporate governance, which adheres to Dutch corporate law and, due to its international listings, relevant EU and U.S. securities regulations.4
A key feature of its corporate structure is the two-tier board system, common for Dutch public companies. This system comprises a Board of Management, responsible for the company's day-to-day management and overall strategy, and an independent Supervisory Board, tasked with overseeing and advising the Board of Management.4 This separation of executive and supervisory functions is a cornerstone of its governance framework. The "Holding N.V." designation reflects its status as a publicly listed entity and its Dutch origins, influencing its adherence to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and EU directives. The two-tier board structure inherently means that while the Board of Management drives initiatives, the Supervisory Board holds significant sway, particularly over major strategic decisions and substantial investments. Any large-scale engagement, such as a comprehensive cybersecurity overhaul, would likely necessitate the Supervisory Board's endorsement, positioning them as critical influencers beyond the operational executive team.
1.2. Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
ASML was founded in 1984.2 The company's global headquarters is situated in Veldhoven, Netherlands. This Veldhoven campus is not merely an administrative center; it is the nucleus of ASML's operations, housing its primary research, development, manufacturing, and assembly facilities.1
Beyond its Dutch epicenter, ASML boasts a significant global presence, with over 60 operational locations strategically positioned worldwide.1 Key international hubs for R&D, manufacturing, customer support, and training include multiple sites in the United States (such as Wilton, CT; Chandler, AZ; San Jose, CA), Germany (Berlin, Dresden), Taiwan (Linkou, Tainan), South Korea (Hwasung), China (Shanghai, Beijing), and Japan (Tokyo).1 This extensive geographic distribution underscores the complexity of ASML's logistical network and IT infrastructure, which must contend with diverse regional regulatory environments and varying security threat landscapes. The Veldhoven headquarters remains the strategic and operational core. The distributed nature of R&D and manufacturing activities across these key international semiconductor centers signifies that critical intellectual property and sensitive operational data are geographically dispersed. This inherently broadens the potential attack surface and necessitates robust, globally harmonized cybersecurity measures—a factor that aligns with the comprehensive security solutions offered by specialized cybersecurity firms.
1.3. Organizational history and key milestones
ASML's journey began in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch technology firm Philips and ASM International.2 It achieved full independence in 1995.2 The company's history is characterized by overcoming substantial technical and financial hurdles through strategic partnerships, critical acquisitions, and relentless innovation.
Key milestones that have shaped ASML include:
Early Years (1980s): Initial struggles marked by reliance on its parent companies, Philips and ASM International.3 A pivotal moment occurred in 1987 with a significant order from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which provided a crucial lifeline.3
First Breakthrough (Early 1990s): The introduction of the PAS 5500 lithography system marked ASML's first major technological and commercial success.2
Entry into EUV Research (1997-1999): Recognizing the future limitations of existing lithography, ASML embarked on research into Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) technology.2
Strategic Acquisitions for EUV and Market Leadership (2000s):
The 2001 acquisition of Silicon Valley Group (SVG) was transformative, providing ASML with critical EUV intellectual property, licenses, and engineering talent.3 This move was instrumental in accelerating ASML's EUV development efforts.
By 2002, ASML had become the largest supplier of photolithography systems globally.2
In 2004, ASML, in collaboration with TSMC, achieved commercial immersion lithography.2
The acquisition of Brion Technologies in 2006 (effective 2007) brought in expertise in computational lithography.5
The "Musketeer Project" and EUV Commercialization (2010s):
In 2012, a landmark initiative known as "The Musketeer Project" saw Intel, Samsung, and TSMC collectively invest in ASML, acquiring a 23% stake and providing substantial R&D funding to propel EUV development.2
The same year, ASML acquired Cymer, a key manufacturer of DUV and EUV light sources, further solidifying its control over critical EUV components.2
In 2016, ASML acquired Hermes Microvision, specializing in e-beam inspection technology, to enhance its holistic lithography solutions.2
After decades of intensive development, ASML successfully commercialized EUV technology in 2019, a milestone that cemented its dominance in the advanced semiconductor equipment market.3
Continued Growth and Innovation (2020s):
The acquisition of Berliner Glas Group in 2020 secured access to high-quality optical components.2

While specific operational sizes for every single location are not publicly detailed, the concentration of R&D, manufacturing, and critical customer support in these strategic hubs highlights the complexity and global distribution of ASML's core activities and its associated IT and OT infrastructure. There is an information gap regarding the precise employee count, facility size, and exact functions performed at each of the 60+ individual locations, though the primary centers of operation are well-documented.
1.7. Detailed corporate structure
ASML Holding N.V. serves as the ultimate parent company in its corporate structure.4 Over the years, ASML has strategically acquired several companies, which now likely operate as integrated subsidiaries or divisions, contributing specialized technologies and capabilities. Notable examples include Cymer, Inc. (light sources), Hermes Microvision, Inc. (e-beam inspection), Berliner Glas GmbH (optical components), Silicon Valley Group (SVG), and Brion Technologies, Inc. (computational lithography).3 For instance, Cymer has been referred to as the "Cymer Light Source division" 5, and Berliner Glas GmbH itself made further acquisitions (BG Medical Applications GmbH and SwissOptic AG) post its integration into ASML.15 ASML US LLC is also a recognized legal entity within the structure.18
The company's operational framework is organized around key business lines or product categories: Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems, Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, and an increasingly important "Applications" business, which encompasses metrology and inspection solutions.35 These product-focused lines are supported by a functional organizational structure that includes core departments such as Research & Development, Manufacturing, Customer Support, Sourcing and Supply Chain, alongside corporate support functions like HR, Legal, IT, Sales & Marketing, and Finance.31 This matrix-like structure, combining product specialization with functional expertise, is typical for large, technologically advanced manufacturing enterprises.
No major company-wide restructuring initiatives have been prominently announced in the recent past, aside from the significant leadership transitions at the executive level. The integration of acquired companies, such as Berliner Glas in 2020, would have inherently involved some degree of organizational and operational restructuring to align with ASML's broader strategic objectives.
ASML's history of mergers and acquisitions is a key aspect of its strategic development. The company has made at least six significant acquisitions:
Berliner Glas GmbH (Germany, optical components) in 2020.2
Hermes Microvision, Inc. (Taiwan, e-beam inspection systems) in 2016 for approximately €3.1 billion.2
Cymer, Inc. (USA, DUV and EUV light sources) in 2012 for approximately €2.2 billion.2
Brion Technologies, Inc. (USA, computational lithography solutions) in 2006 for $270 million.5
Silicon Valley Group (SVG) (USA, lithography systems and EUV IP) in 2000 for $1.6 billion.3
A divestiture of MaskTools occurred in 1999, though it is often listed in its M&A history.15 Additionally, ASML itself was spun off from Philips in 1995.15 These acquisitions have been highly strategic, aimed at securing access to critical technologies, key intellectual property (especially for EUV development), and specialized talent, thereby consolidating its market position and reducing external dependencies.
This M&A strategy, clearly centered on the vertical integration of crucial components and technologies for its lithography systems, provides ASML with greater control over its technology roadmap and supply chain stability. While this is a significant competitive advantage, it also means that ASML internalizes the complexity and security risks associated with these acquired entities' IT and OT environments. Each integration process presents potential cybersecurity challenges, including the need to harmonize disparate systems, data management practices, and security cultures. This ongoing need to secure a growing and increasingly complex internal technology landscape represents a recurring avenue for specialized cybersecurity services, particularly in assessing and securing newly incorporated manufacturing and R&D operations.
1.8. Ownership structure
ASML Holding N.V. is a publicly traded company, with its shares listed on both the Euronext Amsterdam and the Nasdaq stock exchanges under the ticker symbol "ASML".4 This public status subjects it to the rigorous financial reporting and corporate governance standards of these major exchanges and their respective regulatory bodies.
The ownership is characterized by a diverse base, with substantial holdings by institutional investors. As of early to mid-2024/2025 (reporting dates vary by source), major institutional shareholders included:

Mr. Botter's career progression, marked by significant experience in IT operations, infrastructure management, and customer logistics both within ASML and at Philips Healthcare, points to a leadership style that likely prioritizes operational stability, efficiency, and robust support for ASML's complex global manufacturing and supply chain logistics. Security solutions that demonstrably enhance these operational aspects—such as minimizing system downtime, securing critical supply chain data flows, and ensuring the resilience of manufacturing IT—would logically align with his primary objectives.
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) / Chief Security Officer (CSO):
Public information points to two key figures in top security leadership: Dirk van der Horst and Aernout Reijmer.
Dirk van der Horst is identified as the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).19 He leads ASML's Security department, which is a part of the broader Risk and Business Assurance (RBA) department. The RBA department itself reports to the CFO.50 The Security department under Mr. van der Horst provides both first and second-line security services and includes senior managers responsible for specialized areas like IT Security, Product Security, ICS/OT Security, Information & Data Security, and Physical Security Services.50
Aernout Reijmer is also referred to as Chief Security Officer (CSO) and, in some contexts, CISO.19 His background includes a degree in Telecom Engineering from University College London (2007). His experience encompasses his current role at ASML, a prior role as Director of IT Security at ASML (starting in 2015), and CISO positions at BT Global Services and BT EMEA & LATAM.56
The presence of both names in high-level security roles might indicate distinct responsibilities (e.g., operational CISO versus strategic/external-facing CSO), a recent organizational adjustment, or shared leadership. Based on descriptions of the security department's structure 50, Dirk van der Horst appears to oversee the comprehensive internal security organization. The specialized structure of the security department, with dedicated senior managers for critical domains like IT, Product, and ICS/OT security, suggests a mature and nuanced approach to managing diverse security risks. This allows for targeted engagement, where specific cybersecurity services can be aligned with the direct responsibilities of these senior managers, while broader strategic discussions on enterprise-wide risk and security posture would involve the CISO.
Chief Technology Officer (CTO):
Martin van den Brink, a pivotal figure in ASML's technological advancements, including the development of EUV lithography, retired as President and CTO in April 2024. He continues to serve as an advisor to the Board.3 The successor to this critical role, responsible for guiding ASML's future technology roadmap, is not explicitly named in the available public information. This represents an information gap.
Security Operations Leadership:
ASML operates a Security Operations Center (SOC), within which the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) functions. Leadership roles such as "SIRT Team Lead" exist, responsible for managing teams of security analysts who cover incident response across Cyber, IT, OT, DLP, and Physical security domains, as well as threat hunting.60 Additionally, a "Risk & Incident Manager" role is present within the Customer Solutions & Support (CS&S) sector, coordinating with the SOC for incidents pertinent to that business area.61
Compliance and Risk Management Leadership:
The overarching responsibility for risk management, internal control, and compliance resides with ASML's Risk and Business Assurance (RBA) team. This team, which includes the CISO and the entire security apparatus, reports directly to the CFO, Roger Dassen.50 This reporting line is highly significant as it indicates that security strategy and investments at ASML are likely evaluated through a rigorous financial and comprehensive risk management lens. Cybersecurity initiatives requiring substantial budgetary allocation will necessitate strong justification based on quantifiable risk reduction, clear business impact, and alignment with the company's overall business assurance objectives, thereby resonating with the CFO's primary concerns of financial prudence, risk mitigation, and shareholder value. A "Chief Compliance Officer" (initials A.H.) is also listed within the broader leadership structure.54
Digital Transformation Leadership:
Eloy Sasot serves as ASML's Chief Data Officer (CDO). He is responsible for spearheading the development of data management capabilities, data analytics solutions, AI services, and robust data platforms. His prior experience includes leading data and AI transformations at global companies such as Richemont, Sodexo, and News Corp.19 The CDO's mandate is central to ASML's digital transformation journey, which often involves significant cloud adoption and introduces new data security and governance challenges.
The organizational chart depicting the Board of Management and key direct reports such as the CIO, CISO/CSO, and CDO would show a clear hierarchy leading up to the CEO. The Supervisory Board operates in parallel, with its committees (Audit, Technology, ESG, etc.) providing oversight and advice. Influence patterns suggest that while the CISO and CIO manage their respective domains, the CFO holds considerable sway over security and IT investments due to the reporting structure of the Risk and Business Assurance department. The CDO's role in driving data and AI initiatives will necessitate close collaboration with both IT and security teams to ensure these transformations are executed securely. For major strategic technology decisions, particularly those involving significant risk or investment, the Supervisory Board's Technology and Audit committees would be key influencing bodies.
2.4. Middle management in relevant departments
Identifying specific middle management personnel often requires more granular, non-public information. However, based on ASML's organizational structure and job postings, key roles and teams can be inferred:
IT Infrastructure Managers: Within the IT department, career tracks such as "Core IT services" (covering workplace infrastructure, networks, data centers) and "Expertise engineering" (focusing on cloud, cybersecurity, IT architecture) would house various IT infrastructure management roles.63 Leadership positions like "group leader" are part of this structure.63 Publicly available employee directories list individuals such as P.V.R. as Technical Landscape Owner for Connectivity, A.C. as Technical Landscape Owner for IaaS/Compute, and P.W. as Technical Landscape Owner for Storage/Backup, indicating specialized middle management roles within IT infrastructure.19
Security Operations Managers: The Security Operations Center (SOC) includes a SIRT Team Lead who manages security analysts.60 Reporting to the CISO, there are Senior Managers for distinct security domains: IT Security, Product Security, ICS/OT Security, Information & Data Security, and Physical Security Services. These individuals represent key middle-to-senior management in security operations and strategy.50
Network and Systems Administrators: These roles are fundamental to IT operations and would typically reside within the "Core IT services" division or be embedded within specific operational teams in Manufacturing or R&D if dedicated systems are in use. Specific names for these roles are generally not available in high-level public documents.
Procurement and Vendor Management Contacts: Strategic sourcing and procurement are managed at a high level by Wayne Allan, EVP and Chief Strategic Sourcing & Procurement Officer, who is a member of the Board of Management.5 Key figures within his organization include Hein Rensma (Head Of Indirect Procurement), Sheila Leenders (Senior Vice President Sourcing & Procurement), Eduard Stiphout (Senior Vice President Strategic Sourcing & Procurement), Jan de Busser (Vice President Strategic Supply Capacity Preparation), and Michiel Claessens (Vice President Strategic Sourcing & Procurement).43 Engagement for significant contracts and vendor relationships would likely involve this hierarchical structure.
Detailed information on the majority of middle management personnel, including specific responsibilities and contact details, is largely not available through public disclosures, which is typical for large organizations. Deeper investigation using professional networking platforms would be necessary to identify specific individuals within these teams.
2.5. Decision-making patterns
ASML's decision-making is shaped by its two-tier board structure and its functional hierarchy. The Board of Management holds collective responsibility for managing the company, with certain significant decisions requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board.4 This ensures a layer of oversight and strategic alignment for major initiatives.
The fact that the security apparatus, including the CISO, falls under the Risk and Business Assurance (RBA) department, which in turn reports to the CFO, is a critical factor in decision-making for security-related investments.50 This structure implies that financial viability, risk reduction, and business assurance are key criteria in the approval process for security projects.
While specific approval processes for technology purchases are internal, a general pattern can be inferred. Initiatives likely undergo initial technical vetting by relevant teams (e.g., IT engineers, security analysts). Proposals would then move up to department heads (e.g., CIO, CISO). For significant expenditures, approval from the CFO (Roger Dassen) is paramount, and major strategic technology investments may also be subject to review and approval by the Board of Management, and potentially the Supervisory Board, particularly its Audit and Technology committees. The procurement department, under the Chief Strategic Sourcing & Procurement Officer (Wayne Allan), would then handle the sourcing, negotiation, and contractual aspects.
Specific budget authorities and financial approval thresholds are confidential internal details. However, it is standard for C-suite executives to possess higher discretionary spending limits, with the CFO playing a central role in overall financial governance and approval of substantial expenditures.
Successfully navigating ASML's procurement and decision-making landscape for complex cybersecurity solutions necessitates a multi-threaded engagement strategy. This approach must address the distinct concerns and decision criteria of various stakeholders:
Technical Evaluators (IT and Security middle management, engineers): Focus on technical feasibility, integration capabilities, and operational effectiveness of proposed solutions.
Operational Leaders (CIO, CISO, CDO, potentially heads of R&D and Manufacturing for OT-specific solutions): Concerned with operational impact, alignment with departmental strategies, resource allocation, and overall risk posture improvement.
Financial Approvers (CFO, senior finance management): Prioritize return on investment (ROI), quantifiable risk reduction, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with budget cycles and financial controls.
Executive Leadership (Board of Management): Interested in strategic alignment, contribution to overall business objectives, and significant risk mitigation.
Oversight & Advisory Bodies (Supervisory Board committees, particularly Audit and Technology): For very large or strategically critical investments, these committees would assess governance implications, long-term risk impact, and alignment with ASML's technological and strategic trajectory. Understanding these varied perspectives is crucial for tailoring messaging and building the necessary consensus across the organization to advance a sales opportunity.

This integrated approach optimizes chip manufacturing performance, yield, and cost-effectiveness for its customers.22
Unparalleled R&D Capabilities and IP Portfolio: Decades of sustained, high-intensity R&D, often in close collaboration with research institutes and customers, have resulted in a vast and deeply entrenched intellectual property portfolio that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate.21
Deep Customer Partnerships: ASML fosters long-term, strategic partnerships with leading chipmakers, often involving co-investment in R&D and joint problem-solving. This collaborative model ensures its technology roadmap is aligned with customer needs and facilitates rapid adoption of new innovations.3
Core Competencies:
ASML's success is built on a foundation of exceptional core competencies, including:
Mastery of advanced optics, ultra-precision mechanics (mechatronics), high-power laser technology, and plasma physics (essential for EUV light sources).2
Sophisticated system integration capabilities to combine these diverse and complex technologies into reliable high-volume manufacturing tools.
Advanced software development for computational lithography, process control, and real-time system optimization.
Expertise in managing highly complex global supply chains and intricate manufacturing processes for some of the most complex machines ever built.3
Value Proposition Compared to Competitors:
ASML's primary value proposition is its ability to enable customers to continue scaling semiconductor devices according to Moore's Law and beyond, producing smaller, faster, more powerful, and more energy-efficient chips. It offers the most advanced, highest-resolution lithography solutions (EUV and High-NA EUV) essential for leading-edge nodes. In contrast, competitors like Canon and Nikon primarily offer DUV solutions for less critical layers or older technology nodes. While Canon is attempting to introduce NIL as an alternative for some advanced applications, this technology is not yet proven for all high-end, high-volume manufacturing scenarios where EUV currently dominates.3
ASML's strategic acquisitions of key suppliers, such as Cymer for light sources and Berliner Glas for optics, coupled with its profound and decades-long partnership with Carl Zeiss for the development of sophisticated optical systems, grant it an unparalleled degree of control over its critical technology value chain.3 This vertical integration and deep collaboration represent a formidable competitive advantage, significantly reducing external supply risks and enabling tighter co-optimization for accelerated innovation cycles. Competitors lacking this level of control may face greater vulnerabilities in their supply chains or slower progress in specific areas of technological development. However, this strategy also means that ASML internalizes the operational and security risks that might otherwise reside with external third-party suppliers. The security of this extended, internalized value chain—encompassing the R&D, manufacturing, and IT/OT environments of these integrated entities—becomes crucial for maintaining ASML's overall competitive edge and operational resilience. This expanded internal scope presents opportunities for comprehensive cybersecurity services focused on securing these diverse and critical environments.
5. Corporate Culture and Values
ASML's corporate culture and values are foundational to its innovation, operational excellence, and industry leadership.
5.1. Stated mission, vision, and values
ASML articulates a clear sense of purpose and direction through its publicly stated mission, vision, and core values:
Purpose: "Unlocking the potential of people and society by pushing technology to new limits".22 This statement reflects a broad ambition to contribute to societal advancement through technological innovation.
Vision: "We enable groundbreaking technology to solve some of humanity's toughest challenges".22 This positions ASML not just as a manufacturer but as a key enabler of solutions to global problems.
Mission: "Together with our partners, we provide leading patterning solutions that drive the advancement of microchips".22 This highlights the collaborative nature of its business and its core focus on lithography as a driver of semiconductor progress. An alternative phrasing found also emphasizes enabling technological advancement through innovative solutions for the semiconductor industry and being the leading provider of lithography technology.82
Core Values: The company's actions and culture are guided by three primary values 22:
Challenge: Encapsulated by the ethos, "Say it can't be done. We dare you." This value encourages employees to bravely push boundaries, question the status quo, and relentlessly refine ideas and processes to achieve new technological limits.
Collaborate: ASML emphasizes tapping into the collective potential of its entire ecosystem, including customers, suppliers, partners, and internal teams. The focus is on expanding knowledge, learning from one another, and sharing approaches to create optimal solutions for the company as a whole.
Care: This value underscores ASML's commitment to acting with integrity and respect. It acknowledges that the company's impact extends beyond technology to people, society, and the planet. It promotes personal responsibility in creating a safe, inclusive, and trusting environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel encouraged and empowered to contribute, make mistakes, learn, and grow.
Other articulations of its values also include Innovation, Excellence, Customer Focus, Commitment, and Sustainability, which complement the primary three.82 These values collectively suggest a corporate culture that is deeply rooted in technological pioneering, teamwork, and a strong sense of ethical conduct and broader societal responsibility. The "Challenge" value, in particular, points to an environment that embraces ambitious goals and is not deterred by complex problems, a necessary trait for a company operating at the cutting edge of technology.
5.2. Corporate social responsibility initiatives
ASML integrates Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into its core strategy, focusing on areas where it can make a meaningful positive impact. Its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) framework identifies nine key themes, including climate and energy, circular economy, an attractive workplace, responsible value chain management, fostering an innovation ecosystem, and active community engagement.83
The company's Community Partnership Program is a central pillar of its CSR activities, with investments focused on four key areas 84:
Attractive Communities: Initiatives aim to mitigate any negative impacts of ASML's growth and contribute positively to local environments. This includes improving access to sports, arts, and music (e.g., a partnership with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Muziekgebouw in Eindhoven), enhancing biodiversity and green spaces, and fostering intercultural interactions.84
Inclusive Communities: ASML works to remove barriers for disadvantaged community members and create opportunities for them to reach their potential. This involves partnerships with weekend schools and donations to organizations that provide basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.84
STEM Education: To help expand the future technical talent pool, ASML promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. A flagship program is the ASML Junior Academy, developed with Mad Science, which delivers engaging STEM lessons to primary school children. ASML also participates in events like Dutch Technology Week to promote technology careers.84
ESG Sustainability Innovation: The company supports projects with significant societal returns by leveraging its knowledge and expertise. It also invests in ideation, startups, and scale-ups within its communities to maintain a diverse innovation ecosystem.84
ASML encourages employee giving and volunteering. Each employee is entitled to one paid day per year for volunteering activities. Some employees contribute their expertise as STEM ambassadors or part-time teachers. Furthermore, ASML's Matching Gifts program matches employee donations to charitable organizations up to a cumulative amount of €10,000 per employee, per calendar year, in eligible countries.84 In 2023, ASML invested approximately €15 million in community activities through cash and in-kind commitments.86 For 2024, the amount invested per employee, including employee giving, was €1,084, with a target to increase this to €2,500 per employee by 2025.30
5.3. Diversity and inclusion programs
ASML emphasizes that its global workforce, comprising thousands of employees from diverse nationalities and backgrounds, is a key strength that fosters creativity and problem-solving.87 The company states its commitment to welcoming unique voices and treating every individual with care and respect, aiming for an inclusive environment where everyone feels empowered to contribute. This commitment is anchored in its core values of challenge, collaborate, and care.87
ASML's diversity and inclusion strategy is built on three strategic pillars 87:
Talent: Actively working to broaden its talent pool to include more women, neurodiverse individuals, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial backgrounds. The company aims to ensure all employees feel supported in their career growth.
Culture: Cultivating an inclusive culture based on its core values, encouraging employees to value different perspectives and collaborate effectively.
Leadership: Expecting its leaders to serve as role models for diversity and inclusion, building inclusive teams that drive innovation.
To create a supportive environment and enhance a sense of belonging, ASML supports several employee networks 87:
LGBTQIA+ (Proud network): Supports LGBTQIA+ rights and inclusion.
Culture & Nationality (SHADES network): Cultivates resources for the advancement of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color), international, and multicultural employees, relying on allyship.
Women (Women and WAVES networks): Aims to create a strong, connected group of women and supportive colleagues, with a goal to increase gender balance in leadership roles.
Environmental (Green network): Focuses on reducing the environmental impact of the company and individual employees.
Military Veterans: Provides outreach and support to military veterans and their families, recognizing their valuable experience and skills.
Early Career (Next network): Engages, connects, and supports the development of early-career professionals.
Experienced Professionals (Seniors network): Supports colleagues throughout their careers and facilitates knowledge sharing through mentorship and events.
Parents (Parents network): Connects ASML parents for mutual support and information sharing, and promotes family-friendly policies.
In terms of metrics, ASML reported an increase in its female recruitment inflow from 21% in 2021 to 27% in 2023. The percentage of women in senior management rose from 8.4% in 2021 to 11% in 2023.88 For its US operations, 2023 annual figures indicated that women constituted a certain percentage of the workforce and women managers (specific percentages were displayed as "012.89%" and "012.678.234%" in the snippet, suggesting a formatting issue in the source, but the intent to track is clear).88 The 2023 employee engagement survey yielded an inclusion index score (again, displayed with formatting issues as "789.123%").88 The 2023 annual report mentioned that 27% of new hires were women, an increase of 3 percentage points from 2022.86
However, there have been some public discussions regarding the lived experience of employees concerning the work culture. Reports from late 2023 indicated that some employees raised concerns about a "misogynistic working atmosphere" and questioned the representativeness of the company's internal inclusiveness scores, particularly regarding the progression of diverse talent into higher management levels.89 ASML responded by stating it was shocked by such reports and was "working hard to create a company where everyone feels welcome".89 This suggests that while D&I is a stated priority with formal programs, ongoing effort is required to ensure these initiatives translate into a consistently positive and inclusive experience for all employees.
5.4. Environmental and sustainability commitments
Sustainability is a core component of ASML's strategy, with ambitious long-term environmental targets. The company aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2040.26
Key environmental commitments and initiatives include:
Scope 1 and 2 Emissions (Own Operations): Target for net-zero emissions by 2025. Net Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions decreased from 39.4 kt in 2021 and 38.1 kt in 2022 to 35.1 kt in 2023. This was achieved despite company growth, partly through energy-saving projects in the Netherlands, US, and Taiwan, resulting in around 16 TJ of annual energy savings in 2023. The share of renewable electricity used remained high at around 91.4% in 2023.26 DitchCarbon reports a 2025 target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25.2% from 2019 levels, and a long-term target of 90% reduction by 2040.90
Scope 3 Emissions (Value Chain):
Upstream and Downstream: Target for net-zero emissions by 2040.26 In 2023, Scope 3 emissions totaled 15.0 Mt CO2e. The intensity was 1,060 tonnes CO2e per € million gross profit (down from 1,116 tonnes in 2022).26
Business Travel and Commuting: Target for net-zero emissions by 2025. In 2023, these emissions were 70 kt CO2e and 54 kt CO2e respectively, an increase from 2022 due to more employees and fewer travel restrictions.26
Supply Chain (including logistics): Target for net-zero emissions by 2030. In 2023, upstream emissions (excluding travel/commuting) were 5,458 kt CO2e, a 14% increase from 2022, linked to sales growth.26
Product Use at Customers: Target for net-zero emissions by 2040. ASML focuses on reducing energy consumption in new system designs. The EUV light source is a priority for energy reduction efforts. The NXE:3600D system's energy use per exposed wafer pass was 7.7 kWh (2023 measurement), an improvement from 8.3 kWh (2021). The 2025 target is 5.1 kWh.26
Circular Economy: ASML aims to have zero waste from its operations going to landfill and incineration by 2030.84 Strategies include reducing waste in operations, reusing parts and materials from the installed base, and recycling mature products through refurbishment.24 In 2023, 55% of waste was recycled.28
Renewable Energy: ASML aims for 100% renewable energy usage. In 2023, 72.9% of its energy was from renewable sources.28 The 2021 figure for global renewable electricity use was 92% across 57 locations.24
Water Management: This is also listed as an ESG sustainability topic in their 2023 Annual Report.70
ASML's environmental efforts are recognized by external rating agencies. For example, CDP awarded ASML an A- score for climate in 2023 and 2024 (where A is the highest).83 The company is committed to aligning its targets with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C.90
5.5. Corporate communications style
ASML's corporate communications style, as observed from its website, annual reports, and press releases, is generally professional, detailed, and technology-focused. Key characteristics include:
Emphasis on Innovation and Technology: Communications heavily feature technological advancements, the complexity of their systems, and their role in enabling future technologies.1
Data-Driven and Transparent: Financial reports and sustainability updates include specific metrics and targets, aiming for transparency with stakeholders.26
Collaborative Tone: Frequent mention of "partners," "ecosystem," and "collaboration" reflects their business model and cultural values.22
Future-Oriented: A strong focus on future possibilities, long-term growth, and solving "humanity's toughest challenges".9
Formal and Structured: Annual reports and official press releases are formally structured, catering to investors, analysts, and the broader business community.
5.6. Employee review themes from platforms like Glassdoor
Employee reviews provide insights into the internal perception of ASML's culture. While direct access to Glassdoor was not available for this analysis 91, related sources offer some themes:
Overall Positive Ratings: Comparably.com, which aggregates employee reviews, shows ASML with an overall culture rating of A- (Top 15% of similar size companies), with high satisfaction in areas like CEO Rating, Professional Development, Leadership, Perks & Benefits, Compensation, and Environment.92 ASML's Glassdoor rating was cited as 4.1/5 from 3323 ratings, with "Diversity & Inclusion" scoring highest (4.2) and "Senior Management" lowest (3.4), though still positive. Work/life balance, compensation, and career opportunities received scores between 3.7 and 3.9.93
Work-Life Balance: This is a significant topic for employees. While more than half of daytime working employees reported a good work-life balance and flexibility, it was also the most frequently cited topic deserving more attention at ASML.94
Pace of Work: Most participants in Comparably surveys believed the pace of work at ASML is "comfortably fast." About 56% reported working 8 hours or less, while 9% indicated working longer than twelve hours.92
Culture of Challenge and Innovation: The demanding, innovative nature of the work is often highlighted, which can be both stimulating and stressful.
Compensation and Benefits: Generally rated positively on Comparably (A-) 92 and on Glassdoor (3.9/5).93
Management and Leadership: CEO ratings are high on Comparably.92 However, "Senior Management" received a lower (though still positive) score on Glassdoor (3.4/5).93 Some reports mentioned criticisms regarding management culture and the visibility of diversity in higher management tiers.89
Inclusivity: While ASML reports high internal inclusiveness scores (e.g., 82% mentioned in one report 89), some employees have questioned the depth of this inclusivity, particularly concerning the representation of women and minorities in leadership roles.89
These themes suggest a dynamic, fast-paced work environment that offers strong compensation and benefits and is generally perceived positively by many employees. However, areas like work-life balance and ensuring that diversity translates into inclusive leadership at all levels appear to be ongoing points of attention.
5.7. Leadership communication patterns from public sources
Leadership communications, particularly from the CEO and CFO during earnings calls and in annual reports, tend to be:
Strategic and Forward-Looking: Focusing on long-term growth drivers (e.g., AI, new technologies), market trends, and ASML's strategic positioning.9
Balanced and Measured: Acknowledging opportunities while also being transparent about challenges and uncertainties (e.g., geopolitical issues, tariffs, market cyclicality).9
Customer-Focused: Frequent references to customer needs, collaborations, and enabling customer roadmaps.30
Confident in Technological Leadership: Expressing strong belief in ASML's technological capabilities and its role in the industry's future.9
Emphasis on Values: The 2024 Annual Report, for example, explicitly states, "We live by our values to drive success: We challenge. We collaborate. We care.".69
CFO Roger Dassen, in an interview, discussed the evolving role of the CFO to consider a broader range of stakeholder interests beyond just shareholders, including customers, suppliers, employees, and society at large. He also emphasized the importance of intrinsic motivation and excellence.40 CISO Dirk van der Horst's communications (often via recruitment materials for his team) emphasize the critical mission of protecting ASML's assets and the dynamic nature of cybersecurity challenges.53
5.8. Recognition and awards for corporate culture
Specific awards for corporate culture are not detailed in the provided snippets. However, ASML's high employee engagement scores (e.g., 80.3% in 2023, in line with top-performing companies, as mentioned in the 2023 Annual Report video summary 86) and positive ratings on platforms like Comparably (A- overall culture score 92) serve as indirect recognition of its cultural attributes. The company's consistent inclusion in ESG benchmarks with strong ratings (e.g., MSCI AAA, Sustainalytics low risk, CDP A-) also reflects positively on its governance and social practices, which are components of corporate culture.83
The cultural emphasis on "Challenge, Collaborate, Care" 22 is presented as a key driver of success and is consistently communicated. The focus on creating a safe, inclusive, and trusting environment where employees can learn and grow is a stated cultural aspiration.22
Engagement Recommendations
Based on the organizational profile and leadership analysis presented in Part 1, initial high-level recommendations for NCC Group's sales team when approaching ASML include:
Key Stakeholders to Approach:

CIO (René Botter / Allan Cockriel): Essential for IT infrastructure-related security solutions, particularly those impacting operational stability and efficiency.
CFO (Roger Dassen): Crucial for budgetary approval; messaging should emphasize ROI, risk reduction, and business assurance, given the security function reports into the RBA under the CFO.
CDO (Eloy Sasot): Relevant for security solutions related to data governance, analytics platforms, and AI initiatives, especially concerning cloud security.
Relevant Senior Managers within Security: For specialized offerings (e.g., OT Security Manager for ICS/OT services, IT Security Manager for IT GRC).
Chief Strategic Sourcing & Procurement Officer (Wayne Allan) and his team: For contractual and procurement processes.
Organizational Entry Points:
The CISO's office is the most direct entry point for comprehensive cybersecurity discussions.
The CIO's office is relevant for solutions impacting core IT infrastructure and operations.
For OT-specific security, engaging with leadership within Manufacturing or R&D who oversee these environments, in conjunction with the ICS/OT Security Manager, may be effective.
The recent leadership changes (new CEO Christophe Fouquet, new CCO Jim Koonmen) may create openings for fresh perspectives and strategic reviews, making this a potentially opportune time for engagement.
Relationship-Building Strategy:
Acknowledge ASML's technological leadership and the critical nature of its operations.
Emphasize a partnership approach, aligning with ASML's value of "Collaborate."
Focus on long-term value and risk mitigation, appealing to the Supervisory Board's oversight functions and the CFO's priorities.
