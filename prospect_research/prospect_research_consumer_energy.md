GTM Analysis Part 1: Organization Profile & Leadership
TARGET ORGANIZATION: Consumers Energy
Executive Summary
Consumers Energy Company stands as Michigan's largest combined electric and natural gas utility, operating as the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation. It serves 6.8 million of the state's 10 million residents, guided by a purpose of "world class performance delivering hometown service" and a commitment to a "Triple Bottom Line" of People, Planet, and Prosperity.1
Key organizational characteristics reveal a company with a long-standing presence, founded in 1886, currently navigating a significant transformation towards cleaner energy and enhanced grid reliability.4 This includes ambitious goals such as becoming coal-free by 2025 and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, alongside implementing a comprehensive "Reliability Roadmap" for its electric grid.6 A new corporate organizational structure for its parent, CMS Energy, is set to take effect on July 1, 2025, designed to sharpen customer focus and improve operational efficiency across Consumers Energy's functions.10

Recent significant developments underscore the company's strategic direction. These include substantial ongoing investments in renewable energy generation, notably the Sunfish Solar 2 project in partnership with Hecate Energy, continuous upgrades to grid reliability, strategic workforce development initiatives, and fostering partnerships with Michigan-based manufacturers.14 Interactions with and approvals from the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) concerning rate cases and investment plans remain a pivotal aspect of its operational landscape.17
In terms of its competitive positioning, Consumers Energy is the dominant utility provider within its designated Michigan service territory.3 Its primary in-state counterpart is DTE Energy.19 Consumers Energy seeks to differentiate itself through leadership in the clean energy transition, improvements in service reliability, and active engagement with the communities it serves.2
Organizational Profile
1.1 Full legal name and corporate structure
Consumers Energy Company is the full legal name of the utility.21 It operates as the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation.1 CMS Energy Corporation is a publicly traded entity, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CMS.23 Consumers Energy Company itself has previous legal names, including Consumers Power Company of Michigan and Consumers Power Company, reflecting its long history in the state.21 The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) for Consumers Energy Company is 7NKTFWJ1G6MELP9TU740.21
The relationship between CMS Energy and Consumers Energy is one of direct parentage and strategic alignment. Consumers Energy's operational activities and strategic initiatives are fundamentally shaped by the overarching goals and financial framework set by CMS Energy. This interdependence is particularly evident in large-scale endeavors such as the clean energy transition and significant capital investment programs. The new corporate organizational structure announced by CMS Energy, effective July 1, 2025, will further solidify this by directly reshaping Consumers Energy's operational units and the focus of its leadership team.10 Therefore, understanding the pressures, shareholder expectations, and strategic plans of CMS Energy is as critical as analyzing Consumers Energy's specific operational directives.
1.2 Year founded, headquarters location, and significant operational locations
Consumers Energy traces its origins to 1886, when it was founded as Jackson Electric Light Works.2 The corporate headquarters for both Consumers Energy and its parent, CMS Energy, is located at One Energy Plaza, Jackson, Michigan 49201.4
The company's operational footprint is extensive, primarily covering Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Significant operational locations include a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities. These comprise natural gas plants in Zeeland, Jackson, and Covert; thirteen hydroelectric dams situated on the Au Sable, Kalamazoo, Muskegon, Manistee, and Grand rivers; and the Ludington Pumped Storage facility, which is co-owned with DTE Energy.5 In addition to these generation assets, Consumers Energy maintains numerous service centers strategically located across its territory to support its vast customer base. Key service center locations include, but are not limited to, Kalamazoo, Adrian, Saginaw, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Cadillac, Royal Oak, and Flint.3
The company's long history signifies a deeply embedded presence within Michigan, which likely shapes its corporate culture and its relationships with communities and regulatory bodies. The Jackson headquarters serves as the nerve center for corporate leadership and strategic decision-making. The widespread operational locations, especially the power plants and major service hubs, are critical sites for operational technology (OT) security and overall infrastructure management. The geographically dispersed nature of these assets necessitates robust capabilities for remote monitoring, centralized control, and comprehensive security measures across its entire service area.
1.3 Organizational history and key milestones
Consumers Power Company was formally established in 1910 through the amalgamation of the utility interests of W.A. Foote and the partnership of Anton G. Hodenpyl and H.D. Walbridge, which resulted in the creation of Michigan's largest utility company.29 For a period, it was part of the larger utility holding conglomerate Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, regaining its independence in 1946.5 The company reincorporated in Michigan in 1968, maintaining Jackson as its headquarters.5
A significant chapter in its history was the planned Midland nuclear power plant. Construction began in 1968, but the project was abandoned in 1984 due to various issues, including concerns about structural integrity and escalating costs, leading to a $4.1 billion investment write-off that nearly bankrupted the company.5 However, Consumers Power demonstrated resilience by partnering to convert the abandoned nuclear site into a natural gas-fired power plant, the Midland Cogeneration Venture, which successfully began operations in 1991.5 This event marked a crucial recovery and a shift in its generation strategy.
In 1997, the company officially changed its name to Consumers Energy.5 Another key structural change involved the divestiture of its bulk electric transmission system to the Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC), which is now an ITC Holdings company.5 Recent strategic acquisitions to bolster its generation fleet include the Jackson Generation Station (a natural gas plant) in 2016 and the Covert Generating Station (another natural gas facility) in 2023.5
This history, particularly the Midland crisis and the subsequent successful pivot, underscores a corporate capacity for significant transformation and adaptation. The company has navigated major shifts from early hydro and local generation to larger coal and nuclear ambitions, and now to a decisive focus on natural gas as a transition fuel and an aggressive expansion of renewable energy sources under its Clean Energy Plan. This legacy of transformation suggests an ability to undertake large-scale strategic changes. However, the profound financial impact of the Midland nuclear project might also instill a degree of institutional caution and rigorous due diligence when evaluating very large, high-risk capital projects. This could influence its approach to adopting new or unproven technologies, likely requiring compelling return-on-investment analyses and robust risk mitigation strategies for any major technological undertakings.
1.4 Industry classification and primary business activities
Consumers Energy's primary business activities encompass the provision of electric and natural gas utility services. This includes the generation, purchase, limited transmission (as bulk transmission assets were divested), distribution, and sale of electricity. For natural gas, its activities include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas.1 The company serves a diverse customer base, including residential, commercial, and industrial clients throughout its Michigan service territory.25
Based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), Consumers Energy primarily falls under codes related to utilities, specifically:
NAICS 2211: Electric Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution 30
NAICS 2212: Natural Gas Distribution 30
Under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, the corresponding codes are likely:
SIC 4911: Electric Services 31
SIC 4925: Gas Production and/or Distribution 31 (or similar codes like 4922 for Natural Gas Transmission or 4923 for Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution, depending on the specific nuances of their remaining transmission assets).
Its classification as a "combination utility" (providing both electric and natural gas) means that Consumers Energy manages two distinct types of energy infrastructure and delivery systems. Each system has its own unique set of operational technologies, regulatory frameworks, maintenance requirements, and security challenges. This duality inherently increases the complexity of its operations and the scope of its technological and security needs.
1.5 Precise company size metrics
Consumers Energy's financial and operational scale is substantial, as reflected in the metrics of its parent company, CMS Energy.

Note: Market capitalization can fluctuate significantly. Values are approximate based on available data around mid-year or report dates. Employee counts for Consumers Energy are often cited within a range, while CMS Energy figures are more precise from financial reports. Adjusted EPS for 2022 is based on the guidance provided in early 2023 for the prior year, actual reported for 2023 and 2024, and guidance for 2025.
The annual revenue for CMS Energy was $7.515 billion in 2024, a slight increase from $7.462 billion in 2023, which had seen a decline from $8.596 billion in 2022.32 The company is targeting an adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth of 6% to 8% annually.33 For Q1 2025, CMS Energy reported net income of $302 million, up from $285 million in Q1 2024.34
CMS Energy's employee count was 8,324 in 2024, showing a slight decrease in recent years from 9,073 in 2022.41 Consumers Energy itself is frequently cited as having between 7,500 and 8,500 employees.4 The market capitalization for CMS Energy typically hovers around $20-21 billion.23
A key indicator of future activity is the company's aggressive capital deployment strategy. CMS Energy has a $20 billion utility capital plan for the 2025-2029 period, with $3.7 billion planned for 2025 alone.33 This substantial investment is directed towards the Clean Energy Plan and the Reliability Roadmap. These large-scale capital expenditures occur concurrently with stated objectives for "waste elimination savings," such as the over $110 million achieved in 2024 through the "CE Way" efficiency program.33 The combination of massive investment in new infrastructure and technology (renewables, grid modernization) while simultaneously pursuing operational efficiencies and managing headcount suggests a strategic imperative to modernize effectively and affordably. This dual focus may create opportunities for NCC Group to offer solutions that not only secure new, technologically advanced assets but also provide efficiency, automation, or cost savings in existing operations.
1.6 Complete geographic footprint with specific locations and size of operations
Consumers Energy's geographic footprint is extensive, covering all 68 counties in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. It provides natural gas and/or electricity to approximately 6.8 million of the state's 10 million residents.1 More specifically, its electric service reaches 1.8 to 1.9 million customers across 62 counties, while its natural gas service caters to nearly 1.8 million customers in 54 counties.3 Detailed service territory maps are publicly available from Consumers Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC).28
Major metropolitan and urban areas served by Consumers Energy include Battle Creek, Bay City, Cadillac, Flint, Grand Rapids, Jackson (its headquarters city), Kalamazoo, Midland, Muskegon, Saginaw, Lansing, Macomb, Royal Oak, and Livonia.3
The company's power generation assets are strategically located across this territory:
Natural Gas: Key natural gas-fired power plants include the Zeeland Generating Station (930 MW, currently undergoing expansion), the Jackson Generating Station (540 MW), and the recently acquired Covert Generating Station (1,176 MW).5
Hydroelectric: Consumers Energy operates a system of 13 hydroelectric dams with a combined capacity of approximately 130 MW. These are situated along five major Michigan rivers: the Au Sable, Kalamazoo, Muskegon, Manistee, and Grand rivers.5
Pumped Storage: The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant, a significant energy storage facility, is co-owned with DTE Energy and located near Ludington on Lake Michigan.5
Coal (Retiring): The J.H. Campbell plant is slated for retirement in 2025. The D.E. Karn Generating Station retired its coal-fired units 1 and 2 in 2024, with units 3 and 4 continuing to operate on natural gas and/or fuel oil.5
Solar: As part of its Clean Energy Plan to add 8,000 MW of solar capacity by 2040, Consumers Energy is actively developing numerous utility-scale solar projects. Notable projects include Spring Creek Solar (140 MW), Karn Solar (85 MW at the site of the former coal units), Muskegon Solar (250 MW), and the Sunfish Solar 2 project (360 MW).6
This extensive and varied geographic footprint, encompassing a wide range of generation technologies and a vast distribution network, defines the operational scope and the complexity of the infrastructure that Consumers Energy must manage, maintain, and secure. The ongoing transition in its generation portfolio—retiring coal plants while significantly expanding solar and relying on natural gas—is a primary driver of current and future capital projects and technological needs.
1.7 Detailed corporate structure
Consumers Energy Company operates as the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy Corporation.1 CMS Energy also owns NorthStar Clean Energy, which focuses on independent power generation and providing carbon reduction products and services; this entity represents CMS Energy's non-utility operations and investments.1
A significant recent development is the new corporate organizational structure announced by CMS Energy, which will take effect on July 1, 2025.10 This restructuring is designed to support the company's operational transformation and long-term strategy, with an explicit goal of placing the customer at the center of the business. The new structure establishes four key business units within CMS Energy, which will directly influence the operations and leadership of Consumers Energy:
Customer: To be led by Senior Vice President Lauren Snyder as Chief Customer and Growth Officer. This unit will oversee Customer Operations, Customer Experience, Sales, Marketing, Customer Programs, and Economic Development.
Operations & Engineering: To be led by Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer Tonya L. Berry. This unit will encompass:
Electric Supply: Headed by Sri Maddipati as President, responsible for Energy Supply, Generating Plants/Resources, and Supply Development.
Electric Distribution: Headed by Greg Salisbury as President, responsible for the entire electric distribution business, including Operations and Engineering.
Natural Gas Delivery: Headed by LeeRoy Wells, Jr. as President, responsible for the entire natural gas business, including Operations and Engineering.
Legal and Transformation: To be led by Executive Vice President Shaun M. Johnson as Chief Legal and Administrative Officer. This unit will oversee Legal, Compliance, Rates, Regulatory, Lean initiatives, Information Technology, and Application and Analytics Teams. Kelly M. Hall will serve as Senior Vice President Regulatory & Legal Affairs and Deputy General Counsel within this unit.
Finance and Business Support Services: Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Rejji P. Hayes will continue to lead Investor Relations, Treasury, and Accounting, and will now also oversee Supply Chain and NorthStar Clean Energy.
The Strategy, Sustainability, and External Affairs functions will continue to be led by Senior Vice President Brandon J. Hofmeister.10
The merger and acquisition history, detailed in section 1.3, shows a company formed through consolidation that has strategically adapted its portfolio over time, including the divestiture of bulk transmission assets and recent acquisitions of natural gas generation facilities like the Jackson Generation Station (2016) and the Covert Generating Station (2023).5
The impending July 2025 restructuring is of paramount importance for any sales engagement strategy. It redefines leadership responsibilities and reporting lines, particularly for operations, IT, customer-facing functions, and transformation initiatives. The clear delineation of these new units and their respective leaders provides a roadmap for identifying key decision-makers and influencers. This restructuring appears strategically designed to streamline the execution of Consumers Energy's major transformations—the Clean Energy Plan and the Reliability Roadmap—while simultaneously enhancing customer interaction and the adoption of new energy programs and services. The integration of IT and Analytics under the broader "Transformation" umbrella, led by the Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, suggests a strong linkage between technological enablement, overarching transformation goals, and the critical legal and regulatory frameworks within which the utility operates.
1.8 Ownership structure
CMS Energy Corporation, the parent of Consumers Energy, is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "CMS".23 Consumers Energy Company also has preferred stock listed on the NYSE under the ticker "CMS_pb".55
The ownership of CMS Energy is predominantly institutional. Major institutional shareholders include prominent investment management firms such as The Vanguard Group, Inc., BlackRock, Inc., JP Morgan Asset Management, State Street Global Advisors, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc..56 These institutions collectively hold a significant portion of CMS Energy's outstanding shares. Publicly available information does not indicate any recent major shifts in ownership structure beyond the typical trading activities of these large institutional investors.
The status as a publicly traded entity means CMS Energy, and by extension Consumers Energy, operates under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its shareholders. There is a continuous focus on financial performance, delivering shareholder value, and increasingly, on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics. The composition of major institutional shareholders, many of whom have their own ESG investment mandates, likely amplifies the company's commitment to its Clean Energy Plan and other sustainability initiatives. This external pressure reinforces the internal strategic drive towards decarbonization and transparent reporting, as these factors can influence investor confidence, stock performance, and access to capital for the substantial investments required by their transformation plans.

Information Gap: Specific names and roles for middle management in IT operations, security operations, network/systems administration, and direct procurement/vendor management contacts below the VP level are not available from the provided sources.
2.5 Decision-making patterns
As a heavily regulated utility, Consumers Energy's decision-making processes, particularly for significant technology purchases that could impact customer rates or critical infrastructure, are influenced by several layers of approval and oversight.
Regulatory Influence: The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) plays a crucial role. Major investments, especially those tied to strategic initiatives like the Reliability Roadmap or the Clean Energy Plan, often require MPSC approval or must align with MPSC-sanctioned frameworks and rate case outcomes.17 For example, the MPSC's approval of $153.8 million for grid reliability investments in March 2025 (Case No. U-21585) directly enables specific technology and infrastructure upgrades.17
Budget Cycles and Financial Planning: Budgetary decisions are linked to the company's fiscal year (which appears to be the calendar year, based on earnings reports for year-end December 31) and the cadence of regulatory rate case filings and approvals.17 Capital expenditure plans are typically outlined in investor presentations and annual reports, indicating long-term investment horizons.33
Internal Approval Structure (Analysis): Based on the new organizational structure effective July 1, 2025, and general corporate practices, decision-making for significant technology or security investments is likely a multi-faceted process:
Need Identification & Initial Proposal: Originates within relevant operational departments (e.g., IT, Security, Grid Operations, Generation) based on operational requirements, risk assessments, or strategic project needs.
Strategic Alignment: Proposals must demonstrate clear alignment with overarching company strategies such as the Clean Energy Plan, Reliability Roadmap, customer experience enhancements, or "CE Way" operational efficiencies.
Technical Review & Vetting: The IT and Security teams, under CIO Jim G. Beechey, and the Applications and Analytics teams, under CDO Aaron Rajda, would conduct thorough technical evaluations. Relevant engineering teams under the Presidents of Electric Supply (Sri Maddipati), Electric Distribution (Greg Salisbury), and Natural Gas Delivery (LeeRoy Wells, Jr.) would also be involved for operational technologies.
Transformation & Legal Oversight: With IT and Analytics falling under the EVP of Business Transformation and Chief Legal and Administrative Officer (Shaun M. Johnson) from July 2025, this office will play a key role in ensuring technology decisions support transformation goals and meet legal, regulatory, and compliance requirements. Kelly M. Hall (SVP Regulatory & Legal Affairs) would also be involved in compliance aspects.
Financial Scrutiny & Approval: The finance department, led by EVP & CFO Rejji P. Hayes, would review proposals for budgetary fit, return on investment, and overall financial impact. The VP of Supply Chain, Angela D. Henderson, would be involved in procurement aspects.
Executive Endorsement: Final approval for major expenditures would likely come from President and CEO Garrick J. Rochow, potentially with Board of Directors' ratification for very large or strategically critical investments.
Procurement Processes: Consumers Energy utilizes the PowerAdvocate portal for supplier registration.108 The company also emphasizes supplier diversity in its procurement practices.108 For major asset divestitures, such as the sale of hydroelectric dams, a formal, multi-stage Request for Proposal (RFP) process is employed, with clearly defined evaluation criteria including price, organizational stability, financial stability, operational safety and experience, and strength of dam safety programs.109 This suggests a structured and criteria-driven approach to significant procurement and contracting.
Understanding these decision-making patterns is essential for NCC Group. Sales approaches should be timed in consideration of budget cycles and regulatory approval timelines. Proposals must be framed to highlight alignment with Consumers Energy's strategic priorities (reliability, clean energy, customer experience, safety, affordability) and demonstrate a clear understanding of the regulatory landscape. Engaging multiple stakeholders across IT, security, relevant operational units, finance, and potentially legal/transformation will be key to navigating the approval process.

Leadership in Clean Energy Transition: By setting aggressive goals like being coal-free by 2025 (15 years ahead of prior plans) and achieving 90% clean energy by 2040, Consumers Energy positions itself as a frontrunner in decarbonization within the utility sector.8 This appeals to environmentally conscious customers, ESG-focused investors, and aligns with state policy.
Commitment to Reliability through Modernization: The "Reliability Roadmap" is a public commitment to improving service and reducing outages through significant grid investment and technological upgrades.9 This addresses a key customer pain point.
Focus on Michigan's Prosperity: Actively promoting economic development, supporting local businesses, and investing in Michigan communities is a core part of its value proposition.2 The recent public-private partnership with DTE Energy and the State of Michigan to boost local manufacturing for the energy supply chain is an example.16
Energy Affordability Initiatives: While investing heavily, the company also highlights efforts to manage costs and help customers save energy, such as natural gas storage strategies and energy efficiency programs.20
Core Competencies (Analysis):
Utility Operations Management: Extensive experience in operating and maintaining large-scale electric and natural gas infrastructure across a wide geographic area.
Navigating a Regulated Environment: Decades of experience working with the MPSC and other regulatory bodies.
Large-Scale Project Execution: Demonstrated ability to plan and execute major infrastructure projects, including generation plant construction/decommissioning and grid upgrades (though challenges like the Midland nuclear plant are historical counterpoints).
Community and Stakeholder Engagement: Established relationships with local communities, government entities, and business organizations across Michigan.
Value Proposition Compared to Competitors (Analysis):
Compared to DTE Energy, its primary in-state peer, Consumers Energy often emphasizes its slightly broader geographic reach across the Lower Peninsula (though DTE is dominant in Southeast Michigan/Detroit). Both are pursuing similar paths of clean energy transition and grid modernization, making differentiation more nuanced and often focused on specific project timelines, customer service initiatives, or community engagement programs.
The MPSC audit findings on reliability present challenges for both major utilities, but also opportunities to differentiate through faster and more effective improvements.19
Compared to smaller municipal utilities or cooperatives, Consumers Energy can offer a wider range of programs, technological capabilities, and larger-scale investment capacity, but may sometimes be perceived as less locally attuned or more bureaucratic.
Against Alternative Electric Suppliers (AES), Consumers Energy's value proposition for energy supply (for customers who can choose) would rely on price stability, reliability of the underlying company, and potentially bundled services or green energy options not offered by all AESs.
The company's strategic differentiation efforts are evident in its job postings, such as for a "Senior Strategy Manager" tasked with building strategy frameworks and driving business transformation, including facilitating cross-functional teams for customer engagement and navigating transitions to new business models.136 Its business solutions also emphasize helping organizations meet sustainability goals and optimize costs through energy management.135

5.5 Corporate communications style
Consumers Energy's corporate communications style, as observed from press releases, website content, and leadership statements, can be characterized as:
Purpose-Driven and Values-Oriented: Communications frequently tie back to the company's purpose ("world class performance delivering hometown service") and its "Triple Bottom Line" of People, Planet, and Prosperity.2
Customer-Centric: Emphasis on how initiatives benefit customers, whether through improved reliability, cleaner energy, affordability programs, or community support.9
Forward-Looking and Ambitious: Particularly regarding the Clean Energy Plan and Reliability Roadmap, communications highlight bold goals and leadership in transformation.8
Community-Focused: Strong emphasis on being a Michigan-based company serving Michigan communities, with frequent highlighting of local investments, partnerships, and foundation activities.53
Transparent (within regulatory and competitive bounds): Publishes sustainability reports, details on strategic plans (Clean Energy Plan, Reliability Roadmap), and provides regular financial updates. Political engagement policies and contributions are also disclosed.24
Positive and Reassuring: Even when discussing challenges (like storm restoration), the tone aims to reassure customers of their commitment and progress.9

Based on summarized employee reviews from Comparably (as specific Glassdoor summaries were not in the provided snippets, Comparably offers similar insights) 147:
Positive Themes:
Perks and Benefits: Generally well-regarded, including health insurance, PTO, and retirement plans.
Compensation: While overall satisfaction is mixed (rated C), some employees rank compensation in the top 30% for similar companies. Overtime pay structures are noted.
Team Environment: Employees report satisfaction with their teams.
Support for Work-Life Balance: Time off for family is generally supported.
Onboarding: Generally positive experience, with helpful direct managers.

LeeRoy Wells, Jr. (President, Natural Gas Delivery): For OT security concerning natural gas infrastructure.10
Rejji P. Hayes (EVP & CFO): For demonstrating financial ROI and business value of security investments. His oversight of Supply Chain (effective July 1, 2025) also makes him relevant for vendor risk management discussions.10
Angela D. Henderson (VP, Supply Chain): For discussions around third-party risk management, secure procurement, and securing the digital transformation of the supply chain.79
Organizational Entry Points (Analysis):
CIO/CDO Offices: Direct outreach to Jim Beechey and Aaron Rajda regarding specific IT, cybersecurity, and digital transformation security needs.
Transformation Office (under Shaun M. Johnson post-July 2025): For solutions that align with broader business transformation and efficiency goals, especially those leveraging technology and analytics.
Operational Units (Electric Supply, Distribution, Gas Delivery): For OT-specific security solutions, engaging with the respective Presidents or their direct reports responsible for technology and security within those units.
Supply Chain (under Angela D. Henderson / Rejji P. Hayes): For vendor risk management and supply chain security solutions.
Strategic Partnerships/Innovation Teams: If such teams exist (not explicitly detailed but common in transforming utilities), they could be entry points for novel solutions.
Relationship-Building Strategy (Analysis):
Focus on Strategic Alignment: Frame all engagements around Consumers Energy's core strategic pillars: the Clean Energy Plan, Reliability Roadmap, customer experience, and operational excellence (CE Way).
Understand Regulatory Context: Demonstrate awareness of MPSC requirements and how proposed solutions help meet or exceed regulatory mandates (e.g., NERC CIP, grid reliability standards).
Highlight Value to the "Triple Bottom Line": Articulate how security solutions contribute not just to risk reduction (Planet/Prosperity) but also to customer trust and service continuity (People/Prosperity).
Leverage Existing Successes (if any): If NCC Group has successful engagements with other major utilities, especially those undergoing similar transformations, use these as case studies.
Thought Leadership: Share relevant white papers, research, or insights on utility-specific cybersecurity challenges (e.g., OT security for renewables, grid modernization security).
Long-Term Partnership Approach: Position NCC Group as a long-term strategic partner that can support Consumers Energy through its multi-decade transformation, rather than a transactional vendor.
Communication Approach Aligned with Organizational Culture (Analysis):
Professional and Data-Driven: Given the engineering and operational nature of the utility, communications should be factual, well-researched, and supported by data where possible.
Emphasize Reliability and Safety: These are core values and operational imperatives for utilities. Security solutions should be framed in terms of their contribution to these aspects.
Acknowledge Community Commitment: Align messaging with their "hometown service" ethos and commitment to Michigan's prosperity.
Respect for Lean Principles (CE Way): If solutions offer efficiency gains or cost optimization alongside security benefits, highlight these, as it aligns with their "CE Way" operating model.
Collaborative Tone: Reflect their stated value of collaboration and listening. Approach discussions as a partnership to solve challenges.
Timing Considerations Based on Organizational Cycle (Analysis):
Post-Restructure (After July 1, 2025): This is a critical period. New leaders will be settling into roles and defining their priorities and budgets within the new structure. Engaging shortly after this transition, once initial internal alignments are clear, could be opportune.
Budget Cycles: Typically, major budget planning for the following year occurs in Q3/Q4. Understanding their specific fiscal year and budget approval timelines is key. Align proposals with these cycles.
Rate Case Filings/Approvals: Significant investments are often tied to MPSC rate case outcomes. Monitor these proceedings, as approvals can unlock budget for specific projects (e.g., grid modernization funds approved in March 2025 17).
Strategic Plan Milestones: Align engagement with milestones in their Clean Energy Plan or Reliability Roadmap. For example, as new solar projects come online, OT security becomes immediately relevant.
