**X.X Vulnerability Assessment Methodology**

**X.X.1 Overview**

NCC Group's Vulnerability Assessment methodology  provides comprehensive vulnerability identification and assessment across diverse product portfolios. Our methodology adapts to each product's specific architecture, communication protocols, and available artifacts to deliver thorough vulnerability coverage.

**X.X.2 Approach**

Our per-product scoping process identifies the optimal vulnerability assessment strategy based on:

* **Communication Protocols**: TCP/IP Ethernet systems vs. specialized OT protocols (Profibus, RS485, etc.)

* **Available Artifacts**: Source code, binaries, firmware images, container images, RTOS configurations

* **System Architecture**: Embedded systems, Linux-based platforms, mobile applications, HMI interfaces

**X.X.3 Assessment Methods**

**Network-Based Vulnerability Scanning**

* Deployed for TCP/IP Ethernet-accessible systems using OT Tenable, Rapid7, and Nessus

* Comprehensive port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability identification

* Protocol-specific testing for industrial communication standards

**Artifact-Based Vulnerability Analysis**

* Firmware image analysis for embedded systems and PLCs

* Container image vulnerability scanning for Linux-based gateways

* Binary executable analysis when source code is unavailable

* RTOS configuration and hardware abstraction layer assessment

**Specialized OT Assessment**

* Protocol analyzer-based vulnerability identification for non-TCP/IP systems

* Hardware interface vulnerability testing

* Industrial protocol security assessment

**X.X.4 Deliverables**

* **Vulnerability Assessment Report**: Comprehensive findings with CVSS scoring, exploitation scenarios, and remediation guidance

* **Executive Summary**: High-level risk overview with business impact analysis

* **Technical Appendix**: Detailed vulnerability descriptions with proof-of-concept evidence where applicable

**X.X.5 Quality Assurance**

Each assessment undergoes technical review to ensure accuracy and minimize false positives, with findings validated against product-specific operational contexts.
