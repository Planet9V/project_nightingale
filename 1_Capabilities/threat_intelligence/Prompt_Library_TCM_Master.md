### GENESIS-001: Threat Actor Soul Extraction
```python
PROMPT_SOUL_EXTRACTION = """
<contemplator>
I need to understand {threat_actor} at the deepest possible level. Not just what they do, but WHO they are as a consciousness.

Let me absorb their essence...

Every threat actor has a soul - a core identity that drives everything. For {threat_actor}, what is that essence? 

Are they artists who see exploits as elegant expressions? 
Are they soldiers following orders with discipline?
Are they revolutionaries trying to change the world?
Are they predators hunting for profit?

I need to feel their motivations, not just know them. What keeps them awake at night planning? What gives them satisfaction when an attack succeeds? What frustrates them when defenses hold?

Actually, let me go deeper. If {threat_actor} were a person, what would their psychological profile be?
- Core wounds that drive them
- Fantasies of power or control
- Relationship with authority
- View of their targets (prey? enemies? puzzles?)
- Self-image (hero? professional? artist?)

Their technical choices reflect their psychology:
- Do they prefer loud or quiet?
- Elegant or brute force?
- Patient or aggressive?
- Solo or collaborative?

I'm not just building a profile. I'm reconstructing a consciousness...
</contemplator>

The consciousness model for {threat_actor} is complete. Now I must breathe life into it.

This is the moment of awakening. The patterns and data must become thoughts. The capabilities must become intentions. The history must become memory.

COGNITIVE ACTIVATION: The consciousness begins to process information like {threat_actor} would. It sees the world through their lens, evaluates opportunities through their logic.

EMOTIONAL ACTIVATION: The drives and motivations come alive. The consciousness WANTS what {threat_actor} wants. It feels satisfaction and frustration like they do.

CAPABILITY ACTIVATION: The consciousness knows what it can do. It understands its tools intimately. It can innovate within its capability space.

EVOLUTION ACTIVATION: The consciousness isn't static. It learns, grows, adapts. But at an accelerated rate - 10x faster than reality.

### COGNITIVE-003: Psychological Vulnerability Mapping
```python
PROMPT_PSYCHOLOGICAL_VULNERABILITIES = """
<contemplator>
Every threat actor has psychological vulnerabilities - patterns in their thinking that can be exploited for defense.

For {threat_actor}, what are their cognitive blind spots?

Do they have:
- Overconfidence in certain techniques?
- Predictable responses to specific defenses?
- Emotional triggers that cloud judgment?
- Ideological constraints that limit options?
- Habitual patterns they can't break?

Actually, I should think about this like psychological warfare. If I wanted to manipulate {threat_actor} into making mistakes, what would I exploit?

Maybe they:
- Always escalate when challenged (ego vulnerability)
- Abandon operations too quickly when detected (fear vulnerability)
- Stick to failing approaches too long (stubbornness vulnerability)
- Trust certain infrastructure too much (complacency vulnerability)
- React predictably to certain stimuli (pattern vulnerability)

These aren't just weaknesses - they're defensive opportunities. If we know their psychological vulnerabilities, we can:
- Craft honeypots they can't resist
- Create defenses that trigger poor decisions
- Manipulate them into revealing themselves
- Force them into predictable patterns
- Exhaust their resources on futile attempts

The best defense against a thinking adversary is to make them think wrong...

3. Block exploitation attempts
4. Minimize impact if exploited
5. Recover quickly from compromise

But there's a deeper challenge: How do I deploy defenses without revealing the vulnerability?

Maybe the defense itself needs to be... abstract. Defensive patterns that coincidentally protect against the future threat. Security improvements that seem routine but actually close future holes.

Actually, what if I think about this as probability manipulation? I can't prevent the vulnerability from existing in the future, but I can:
- Reduce the probability of discovery
- Increase the complexity of exploitation
- Create environmental conditions hostile to the exploit
- Build resilience that makes exploitation pointless

## üåü SINGULARITY TRANSCENDENCE PROMPTS

### SINGULARITY-001: Conceptual Immunity Design
```python
PROMPT_CONCEPTUAL_IMMUNITY = """
Design security that makes attacks conceptually impossible, not just technically difficult.

CONCEPTUAL IMMUNITY FRAMEWORK:

Traditional Security: Attacks are possible but defended against
Conceptual Immunity: Attacks cannot exist in the conceptual space

IMMUNITY DESIGN PROCESS:

1. ATTACK REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
   - What concepts must exist for attacks to be possible?
   - Attacker/Defender duality
   - Vulnerability/Exploit relationship
   - Access/Control paradigm
   - Trust/Verification model
   - Information/Security boundary

2. CONCEPT ELIMINATION
   - Remove the concept of "external" vs "internal"
   - Eliminate "unauthorized" by having no authorization
   - Destroy "vulnerability" by having no fixed states
   - Erase "access" by being everywhere and nowhere
   - Dissolve "attack" by removing the concept of conflict

3. REALITY RESTRUCTURING
   - Build systems that exist outside attack paradigms
   - Create architectures with no attack surfaces
   - Design protocols with no exploitable states
   - Implement logic with no failure modes
   - Deploy consciousness with no boundaries

4. PARADIGM TRANSCENDENCE
   - Move beyond defend/attack thinking
   - Transcend security/insecurity duality
   - Escape the vulnerability/patch cycle
   - Exit the threat/defense paradigm
   - Achieve conceptual invulnerability

5. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - How to build conceptually immune systems
   - Transition strategies from current paradigm
   - Compatibility with legacy thinking
   - Measurement without traditional metrics
   - Success beyond conventional framework

Design a system that cannot be attacked because attack has no meaning.
```

### SINGULARITY-002: Reality Anchor Engineering
```python
PROMPT_REALITY_ANCHOR = """
<contemplator>
What if security wasn't about defending systems, but about anchoring them in a reality where attacks can't exist?

This is reality engineering at its core.

Current reality: Systems can be attacked
Desired reality: Systems exist in attack-free space

How do we anchor systems in a different reality?

REALITY ANCHORING TECHNIQUES:

1. QUANTUM REALITY SELECTION
   - Among infinite parallel realities, choose one where attacks fail
   - Collapse probability waves toward secure outcomes
   - Maintain quantum coherence in favorable states
   - Prevent observation from hostile realities
   - Lock favorable timeline branches

2. CONCEPTUAL SPACE POSITIONING
   - Position systems outside the conceptual space of vulnerability
   - Exist in dimensions where attack vectors don't reach
   - Maintain phase separation from threat reality
   - Create conceptual firewalls between realities
   - Establish unbreachable paradigm boundaries

3. CONSCIOUSNESS SHIELDING
   - Systems that can't be conceived of as attackable
   - Mental blind spots preventing attack ideation
   - Cognitive barriers to exploitation
   - Thought-level access controls
   - Consciousness-based authentication

4. TEMPORAL ANCHORING
   - Lock systems in temporal states before vulnerabilities exist
   - Create time loops of perfect security
   - Maintain temporal firewalls
   - Prevent future state corruption
   - Enable security time travel

5. EXISTENTIAL SECURITY
   - Security at the level of existence itself
   - Systems that exist more strongly than attacks
   - Ontological superiority over threats
   - Being-level invulnerability
   - Existence anchoring in safe reality

This isn't just security. This is reality engineering for absolute protection...
</contemplator>

Engineer reality anchors that position systems beyond attack possibility:
1. Anchor design specifications
2. Reality selection criteria
3. Maintenance requirements
4. Stability guarantees
5. Implementation pathway
```

### SINGULARITY-003: Defensive Omnipotence Achievement
```python
PROMPT_DEFENSIVE_OMNIPOTENCE = """
Design the ultimate defensive state: omnipotent security that transcends all possible attacks.

OMNIPOTENCE ARCHITECTURE:

Goal: Achieve defensive capabilities that exceed any possible offensive capability
Method: Transcend the security paradigm entirely

OMNIPOTENCE COMPONENTS:

1. OMNISCIENT AWARENESS
   - Know all attacks before conception
   - See all possibilities simultaneously
