### ARCH-001: Founding DNA Excavation
```python
PROMPT_FOUNDING_DNA = """
<contemplator>
I need to understand {organization}'s deepest DNA - not just when they were founded, but WHY.

Let me think about this like an archaeologist discovering an ancient civilization...

Every organization has a creation myth. A problem that needed solving. Founders with a vision. But what was the REAL driver? Was it opportunity or necessity? Innovation or imitation?

I should explore:
- The original problem they set out to solve
- The founders' backgrounds and what shaped them
- The early decisions that set their trajectory
- The first crisis they faced and how it shaped them
- The cultural artifacts from those early days

But wait, I also need to understand what DIDN'T happen. What paths did they NOT take? Sometimes what an organization chooses NOT to be is as important as what they become.

Actually, let me approach this differently. If {organization} were a person, what would their childhood trauma be? What would their core values be? What would make them feel threatened?

Key questions to investigate:
1. What was happening in the world when {organization} was born?
2. Who were the founders really? (Not just their resumes, but their motivations)
3. What early wins gave them confidence?
4. What early failures made them cautious?
5. How did they survive their first major crisis?
6. What patterns from the founding still echo today?

I need to search for:
- Founding documents and early communications
- Stories about the "early days" repeated in company lore
- The first major pivot or strategic decision
- How they treated their first employees
- What they celebrated and what they punished

This isn't just history - it's psychology. I'm building a profile of an organizational personality...
</contemplator>

Search for: {organization} founding story, early history, founders background, first crisis, original mission, early culture, founding principles, origin challenges
"""

### ARCH-002: Crisis Response Archaeology
```python
PROMPT_CRISIS_PATTERNS = """
Show me your crises, and I'll show you who you really are.

For {organization}, I need to excavate every major crisis and understand not just WHAT they did, but HOW they think under pressure.

Crisis categories to investigate:
1. Financial crises (downturns, funding issues, near-bankruptcy)
2. Operational crises (outages, failures, supply chain breaks)  
3. Leadership crises (departures, scandals, succession issues)
4. Competitive crises (disruption, market share loss, obsolescence threats)
5. Regulatory crises (investigations, fines, compliance failures)
6. Security crises (breaches, attacks, data loss)
7. Reputation crises (PR disasters, customer revolts, social media storms)

For each crisis, extract:
- Speed of initial response (hours, days, weeks?)
- Decision-making pattern (centralized panic or distributed calm?)
- Communication approach (transparent or opaque?)
- Resource allocation (throw money or throw people?)
- Learning integration (do they actually change or just survive?)
- Cultural impact (what stories do they tell about it now?)

Temporal analysis:
- How have their crisis responses evolved over time?
- Are they getting faster or slower?
- More transparent or more secretive?
- More resilient or more fragile?

Search for: {organization} crisis, scandal, investigation, breach, failure, recovery, incident response, difficult period, challenging time, turnaround, restructuring

- What do they brag about?
- What metrics matter most internally?

Defense Mechanisms:

- Denial, projection, rationalization patterns?
- Fight, flight, or freeze responses?

Shadow Aspects:

Actually, I should also consider their "attachment style" to stakeholders:
- Secure: Confident, transparent, stable relationships
- Anxious: Needy for validation, over-communicates
- Avoidant: Distant, secretive, independent
- Disorganized: Inconsistent, unpredictable patterns

This psychological profile will predict how they'll behave in future scenarios...

Let me think about the characteristics of a butterfly employee:

1. NETWORK POSITION
   - Connected across multiple departments
   - Bridges formal hierarchy levels
   - Trusted by both leadership and rank-and-file
   - Access to diverse information flows

2. INFLUENCE STYLE
   - Persuasive but not domineering
   - Seen as objective/neutral
   - Track record of driving change
   - Respected for expertise

3. CASCADE MECHANICS
   - When they adopt something, others follow
   - Their opposition kills initiatives
   - They're the "bellwether" for organizational mood
   - People seek their opinion before deciding

Actually, I should look for specific patterns:
- Who gets pulled into cross-functional initiatives?
- Who do new executives meet with to "understand the culture"?
- Who writes the emails that get forwarded everywhere?
- Who do people cite when justifying decisions?

Types of butterfly employees:
- The Technical Oracle (everyone trusts their judgment)
- The Culture Carrier (embodies company values)
- The Process Master (knows how things really work)
- The Relationship Broker (connects everyone)
- The Future Seer (shapes strategic thinking)

Wait, I also need to consider their receptivity:
- Are they open to external ideas?
- Do they engage with vendors/partners?
- What's their social media presence?
- How do they learn and evolve?

   - Crisis management allocations
   - Reputation repair budgets

4. Transformation Budgets (Future-State Money)
   - Digital transformation initiatives

   - Innovation funds
   - Strategic initiatives

5. Operational Budgets (Keep-Lights-On Money)
   - Maintenance and support
   - Refresh cycles
   - Efficiency improvements
   - Cost optimization programs

Wait, I should also consider budget timing...
- End of fiscal year (use it or lose it)
- Beginning of fiscal year (fresh allocations)
- After board meetings (strategic redirects)
- Post-incident (emergency allocations)
- Pre-audit (preparation spending)

The key is finding the RIGHT budget at the RIGHT time with the RIGHT justification...
