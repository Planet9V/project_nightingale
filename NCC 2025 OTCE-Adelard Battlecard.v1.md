# OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & ADELARD GROWTH PLAN \-- BATTLE CARD

**NCC Solution Outcomes**

* **Risk Unification**: Singular view of both security and safety risks with combined criticality scoring  
* **Certification Protection**: Security controls that enhance rather than jeopardize safety certifications  
* **Regulatory Acceleration**: 40% faster compliance achievement across security and safety domains  
* **Operational Continuity**: Zero-impact security implementation that preserves production and safety

**NCC Solution Key Features**

* **Facility Due Diligence (FDD)**: OT asset discovery with zero operational impact, vulnerability and threat analysis, network topology mapping, and safety system assessment with SIL validation  
* **Industrial Architecture & Security Controls**: Defense-in-depth OT architecture with zone-based segmentation combined with safety-security integrated design patterns and IEC 61508 compliant security architecture  
* **OT Incident Response & Recovery**: 24/7 OT-specific incident response with Dragos-powered threat hunting and safety system investigation that preserves safety functions and certification  
* **OT Security Monitoring & Detection**: Dragos Platform implementation with behavioral-based anomaly detection and ASCE integration providing automated safety evidence collection and continuous certification monitoring  
* **OT Security Program & Governance**: IEC 62443 security program implementation aligned with IEC 61508/61511 safety program integration for unified governance and streamlined compliance  
* **OT-Specific IAM/PAM Solutions**: Purpose-built industrial identity management and privileged access controls for OT environments that secure vendor, operator, and third-party access while maintaining safety certification.

**NCC Solution Key Benefits**

**Discovery Questions for Sales**

1. How would a cyber incident impact your industrial operations, and what would be the financial and safety implications?  
2. What safety-critical systems or safety-instrumented systems do you operate, and how are you currently addressing their cybersecurity?  
3. What regulatory frameworks apply to both security and safety in your industrial environment?  
4. How integrated are your safety and security teams, processes, and technologies today?  
5. What visibility do you have into your OT assets, their vulnerabilities, and their connections to safety systems?

**Key Challenges to Listen For**

* **Operational Resistance**: "We can't risk production disruption for security changes." (Respond with zero-impact assessment methodology)  
* **Safety Certification Concerns**: "Security changes might compromise our safety certifications." (Highlight certification-maintaining security approaches)  
* **Siloed Governance**: "Safety and security are managed by separate teams with different priorities." (Discuss governance unification benefits)  
* **Legacy System Constraints**: "We have critical systems that can't be patched or updated." (Present compensating controls with safety validation)  
* **Budget Limitations**: "We don't have dedicated budget for OT security initiatives." (Explain CapEx approach for security investments)
