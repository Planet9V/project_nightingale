## Integrated GTM Process

### **Phase 1: Threat Intelligence Research**

#### **1.1 Sector-Specific Threat Identification**
```markdown
Claude Coder Automation Prompt:

"Based on the target sector [MANUFACTURING/ENERGY/WATER/FOOD], identify 3 current, 
high-impact ransomware or threat actor campaigns from the past 6 months using MCP 
Tavily search capabilities. Focus on threats that:

1. Have occurred within the last 6 months (current relevance)
2. Target the specified sector's operational technology
3. Have documented MITRE ATT&CK techniques
4. Include CVEs or specific vulnerabilities
5. Have forensic evidence or incident reports available

For each threat, provide:
- Threat actor/malware family name
- Primary attack vector and timeline
- Key CVEs or vulnerabilities exploited  
- Sector-specific impact and operational consequences
- MITRE ATT&CK technique list

Prompt user to select preferred threat for Express Attack Brief generation."
```

#### **1.2 MITRE ATT&CK Validation**
```markdown
Before generating Technical Analysis document, always:

1. Use MCP Tavily search to validate MITRE ATT&CK technique accuracy
2. Cross-reference techniques with current MITRE framework (v14.1+)
3. Verify technique IDs and subtechnique classifications
4. Confirm data sources and mitigation mappings
5. Ensure procedural descriptions match documented threat behavior

Search Query Format: "[THREAT_NAME] MITRE ATT&CK [TECHNIQUE_ID] [TECHNIQUE_NAME]"
```

### **Phase 2: Document Generation**

#### **2.1 Optimized Express Attack Brief Generation**
```bash
# Generate Document 1 using established prompt
python generate_optimized_brief.py \
  --threat "[THREAT_NAME]" \
  --sector "[TARGET_SECTOR]" \
  --template "/templates/OPTIMIZED_EXPRESS_ATTACK_BRIEF_GENERATION_PROMPT.md" \
  --output "/final_products/NCC-OTCE-EAB-[###]-[THREAT_NAME]-Optimized.md"
```

#### **2.2 Technical MITRE Analysis Generation**
```bash
# Generate Document 2 with MITRE validation
python generate_technical_analysis.py \
  --threat "[THREAT_NAME]" \
  --incident-ref "[INCIDENT_ID]" \
  --template "/templates/TECHNICAL_MITRE_ANALYSIS_GENERATION_PROMPT.md" \
  --mitre-validation true \
  --output "/final_products/NCC-OTCE-EAB-[###]-[THREAT_NAME]-Technical-Analysis.md"
```
