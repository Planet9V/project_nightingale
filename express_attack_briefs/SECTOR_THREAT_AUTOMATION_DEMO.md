## Step 2: User Selection & Document Generation

### **User Interaction**
```markdown
Claude Coder: "Which manufacturing threat would you like me to analyze with 
Express Attack Brief dual documents?

1. üè≠ LockBit 3.0 - VPN to OT lateral movement (Classic attack path)
2. üîó ALPHV/BlackCat - Supply chain compromise (Advanced persistent threat)  
3. ‚ö° Akira - RDP to SCADA encryption (Direct operational impact)

I'll generate both:
- Executive-friendly intelligence brief for manufacturing leadership
- Technical MITRE analysis for SOC teams and incident responders"

User Selection: "Generate documents for ALPHV/BlackCat supply chain compromise"
```

### **Automated Document Generation Process**

#### **Phase 1: MITRE Validation Research**
```bash
# Automated MITRE technique validation using MCP Tavily
mcp__tavily__tavily-search query="ALPHV BlackCat MITRE ATT&CK T1195.002 supply chain compromise"
mcp__tavily__tavily-search query="CVE-2024-23897 Jenkins vulnerability MITRE technique mapping"
mcp__tavily__tavily-search query="BlackCat ransomware T1071.001 application layer protocol MITRE"
```

#### **Phase 2: Document Generation**
