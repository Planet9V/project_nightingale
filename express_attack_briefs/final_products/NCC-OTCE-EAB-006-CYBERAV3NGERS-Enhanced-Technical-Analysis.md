## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Document purpose

This document has been prepared for Energy Sector Security Operations Teams and Critical Infrastructure Protection organizations with responsibility for national energy security, strategic energy infrastructure protection, and Iranian nation-state threat response.

This document describes the attack methodology observed during the CYBERAV3NGERS Iranian nation-state strategic cyber operation targeting United States energy infrastructure, documented through enhanced multi-source government intelligence analysis including joint CISA, FBI, and NSA coordination from October 2024 through ongoing 2025 operations. It presents the step-by-step technical methodology taken by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) affiliated actors to establish strategic prepositioning in energy sector operational technology through advanced persistent access, long-term capability development, and coordinated infrastructure targeting, including associated Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (TTP) details with enhanced confidence scoring. All TTPs are expressed in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise and ICS terminology to aid in correlation and cross-referencing with Iranian nation-state threat intelligence sources and energy sector security operations center detection capabilities.

This document is aimed at helping energy sector security operations teams understand Iranian nation-state strategic targeting methodology and prepare to defend against long-term prepositioning campaigns affecting power generation and grid infrastructure essential for national energy security. The attack path structure demonstrates how IRGC-affiliated actors systematically target energy operational technology for strategic positioning rather than immediate disruption. The inclusion of detailed forensic evidence with confidence assessment and enhanced TTP mappings allows security teams to implement specific detection and response capabilities for Iranian nation-state threats affecting strategic energy infrastructure.
