## Mission Context

### Protecting Essential Infrastructure for Future Generations

FrostyGoop represents a direct assault on the infrastructure that ensures **reliable energy** for our grandchildren. This malware's successful manipulation of heating systems during Ukraine's harsh winter demonstrates how cyber attacks can weaponize critical infrastructure against civilian populations, threatening the basic human needs for warmth and shelter. The attack's cascading effects impacted water pumping stations (threatening **clean water**) and food storage facilities requiring refrigeration (compromising **healthy food** access) [[15]](#ref15).

### Strategic Implications
- **Energy Security**: Direct manipulation of energy distribution systems bypassing traditional safeguards [[16]](#ref16)
- **Water Infrastructure**: Secondary impacts on water pumping requiring electric heat tracing in winter [[17]](#ref17)
- **Food Supply Chain**: Cold storage facilities lost temperature control affecting food safety [[18]](#ref18)
- **Intergenerational Impact**: Demonstrates vulnerability of legacy ICS systems our children will inherit [[19]](#ref19)
