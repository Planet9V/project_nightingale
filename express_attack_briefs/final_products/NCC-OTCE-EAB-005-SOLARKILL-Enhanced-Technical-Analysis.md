## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Document purpose

This document has been prepared for Energy Sector Security Operations Teams and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Protection organizations with responsibility for solar generation, clean energy coordination, and sustainable energy infrastructure cybersecurity.

This document describes the attack methodology observed during the SOLARKILL supply chain compromise campaign targeting Chinese-manufactured solar power inverters with embedded hardware backdoors, documented through enhanced multi-source intelligence analysis from initial discovery in May 2025 through ongoing operational assessment. It presents the step-by-step technical methodology taken by state-sponsored actors to systematically compromise renewable energy infrastructure through strategic supply chain infiltration, advanced hardware backdoor implementation, and coordinated clean energy disruption, including associated Tactic, Technique, and Procedure (TTP) details with enhanced confidence scoring. All TTPs are expressed in MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise and ICS terminology to aid in correlation and cross-referencing with renewable energy threat intelligence sources and clean energy security operations center detection capabilities.

This document is aimed at helping renewable energy sector security operations teams understand supply chain hardware compromise methodology and prepare to defend against sophisticated embedded backdoor campaigns affecting solar generation infrastructure. The attack path structure demonstrates how state-sponsored actors systematically target clean energy infrastructure for strategic disruption rather than opportunistic compromise. The inclusion of detailed forensic evidence with confidence assessment and enhanced TTP mappings allows security teams to implement specific detection and response capabilities for renewable energy threats affecting sustainable energy infrastructure.
