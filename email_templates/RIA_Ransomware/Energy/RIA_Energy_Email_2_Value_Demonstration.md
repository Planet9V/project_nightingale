**Email Body**:

[EXEC_NAME],

Following up on our [RECENT_THREAT] intelligence brief sent last week.

**Breaking**: [PEER_COMPANY] disclosed $[X]M in losses from [OPERATIONAL_THREAT] ransomware targeting their [ENERGY_TYPE] operations. Their [AFFECTED_SYSTEM] went offline for [Y] days, affecting [COMMUNITY_IMPACT_SCALE].

**Why This Matters to [COMPANY_NAME]**:
Our tri-partner analysis reveals [PEER_COMPANY] and [COMPANY_NAME] share similar [TECHNICAL_SIMILARITY] infrastructure. The same [ATTACK_VECTOR] that compromised their [CRITICAL_SYSTEM] exists in [ENERGY_TYPE] facilities across [GEOGRAPHIC_REGION].

**Intelligence Advantage**: We've identified [VULNERABILITY_FINDING] in [COMPANY_NAME]'s [OPERATIONAL_AREA] that creates identical exposure. This isn't theoretical - it's a documented attack path we see targeting [ENERGY_TYPE] operations.

**Peer Comparison Advantage**:
```
[PEER_COMPANY]:     Unknown vulnerabilities → $[X]M loss + [Y] days down
[COMPANY_NAME]:     Known vulnerabilities → Proactive protection available
```

**15-Minute Strategic Brief**: I'll share:
✓ [PEER_COMPANY]'s exact failure points and how [COMPANY_NAME] differs  
✓ [VULNERABILITY_FINDING] assessment specific to your [OPERATIONAL_AREA]  
✓ 30-day operational resilience validation methodology  
✓ Cost-benefit analysis: $[X]K assessment vs. $[X]M potential loss  

**Mission Alignment**: While [PEER_COMPANY] recovers, [COMPANY_NAME] can lead [ENERGY_TYPE] sector resilience, protecting [COMMUNITY_DEPENDENCE] and ensuring reliable energy for future generations.

Two options:
1. **Strategic Brief**: 15 minutes this week - [CALENDAR_LINK]
2. **Deep Dive**: Download our [COMPANY_NAME] Ransomware Readiness Assessment framework
