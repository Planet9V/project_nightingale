The CyberArmyofRussia\_Reborn (BAUXIT) attacks on critical infrastructure in the US, specifically targeting water and oil & gas facilities, demonstrated a concerning ability to interact with and manipulate industrial control systems. By gaining access to Human Machine Interface (HMI) devices, the threat actors showcased the potential for direct operational disruption, raising alarms about the security of these critical interfaces 9. This incident highlights the risk posed by inadequate security measures surrounding OT systems that are either directly exposed or accessible through vulnerable pathways.

VOLTZITE's activities in early 2024, involving interactions with a US telecommunications provider and command-and-control (C2) activity originating from an emergency services GIS, suggested a more subtle, long-term intelligence-gathering objective. While not immediately disruptive, the establishment of a persistent presence within these critical sectors could pave the way for future disruptive actions or the exfiltration of sensitive information 9. The later rebuilding of the KV-Botnet further illustrated VOLTZITE's determination to maintain a covert infrastructure for their operations, targeting a wide range of organizations in critical sectors 9.

The exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ubiquiti EdgeRouters by the GRAPHITE threat group underscores the importance of securing all network devices within an organization's infrastructure, even those that might be perceived as less critical to OT operations. These routers served as a launchpad for various malicious activities, including credential theft and the establishment of command and control, ultimately potentially providing access to interconnected OT environments 9. The reuse of infrastructure from previous campaigns by other threat groups suggests a degree of coordination or shared resources within the threat landscape.

The breach at American Water Works, while the initial entry method remains unspecified in the provided snippets, resulted in significant disruptions to customer-facing IT systems, which in turn impacted operational processes. The cascading effect of this breach highlights the risks associated with the increasing convergence of IT and OT environments, where a compromise in one domain can have repercussions in the other 12. This incident emphasizes the need for holistic security strategies that consider the interconnectedness of these systems.

Kaspersky's discovery of the SalmonSlalom campaign targeting industrial organizations in the Asia-Pacific region revealed a sophisticated attack chain involving the use of legitimate cloud services to deliver the FatalRAT backdoor. The reliance on social engineering via various communication channels like email, WeChat, and Telegram demonstrates the continued effectiveness of these tactics in gaining initial access to target networks 13. The use of a multi-stage payload delivery framework further highlights the efforts of threat actors to evade detection.

The iocontrol malware attacks, attributed to the Iran-affiliated CyberAv3ngers (BAUXIT), demonstrated a direct targeting of OT and IoT devices across various vendors in Israel and the US. The compromise of fuel management systems illustrates the potential for this malware to impact physical processes, highlighting the real-world consequences of cyberattacks on industrial control systems 9. The use of the MQTT protocol for command and control indicates a specific focus on blending malicious traffic within OT networks.

The significant surge in GPS jamming and spoofing incidents in 2024, particularly affecting the aviation sector, presents a unique challenge to OT security. While primarily impacting navigation systems, the degradation or manipulation of GPS signals can have cascading effects on various OT systems that rely on accurate timing and location data 1. The increasing frequency of these incidents, often linked to military activity in conflict zones, underscores the geopolitical dimension of OT security.

The consistent pattern of exploiting known vulnerabilities and targeting outdated equipment across numerous incidents in 2024 underscores a significant deficiency in fundamental security practices within many OT environments. This suggests a critical need for organizations to prioritize and improve their basic security hygiene, including robust asset management and timely patching. Furthermore, the American Water Works breach serves as a stark reminder of the increasing interconnectedness between IT and OT networks. Vulnerabilities in one domain can readily impact the other, necessitating a unified and holistic approach to security that encompasses both environments.

## **Threat Actor Profile: Bauxit (CyberAv3ngers)**

Bauxit, also known as CyberAv3ngers, is a threat group believed to be affiliated with Iran, demonstrating a persistent focus on targeting Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, primarily in Israel and the United States, throughout 2024 14. Dragos's observations in June 2024 revealed Bauxit conducting reconnaissance and research against OT/ICS entities and devices 9. Although immediate disruptive activity was not detected, the analysis indicated a likely intent to utilize the gathered intelligence in future operations aimed at compromising the availability, visibility, or control of targeted systems. This activity marked the fifth known campaign by Bauxit targeting or impacting OT/ICS entities, highlighting their sustained interest and developing capabilities in this domain 9.

A significant incident attributed to Bauxit in November 2024 involved the deployment of a specific Linux-based malware identified as iocontrol 9. This campaign affected approximately 400 victims across a diverse range of vendors, underscoring the malware's broad applicability or the group's wide-reaching targeting efforts. One notable instance of Bauxit's activity involved the compromise of hundreds of fuel management systems from Orpak Systems in Israel and Gasboy in the United States using the iocontrol malware 14. This attack wave demonstrated the group's capacity to target specific industrial control systems with the potential for direct manipulation of physical processes, such as fuel pumps 14. The November campaign further revealed that the iocontrol malware impacted a wide array of industrial control system (ICS) and operational technology (OT) equipment from vendors including Orpak, Phoenix Contact, Unitronics, Baiells, Node-RED, Red Lion Controls, Hikvision, Teltonika, Orange Livebox, Tridium, Sonicwall, Ubiquiti, Watchguard, and Fortinet 9. This extensive list of affected vendors suggests either a broad, opportunistic exploitation of vulnerabilities or a more strategic selection of targets based on specific industrial equipment types.

The primary tactic employed by Bauxit in 2024, as evidenced by available reports, was the utilization of the custom-built iocontrol malware 9. This malware is a Linux-based backdoor designed with a modular configuration that allows it to target various IoT, OT, and SCADA systems 25. A key technique observed was iocontrol's use of the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for establishing command and control communication 9. This highlights a specific procedural element aimed at blending malicious traffic within OT networks that commonly utilize this protocol for legitimate communication. The malware also deploys a backdoor that communicates with a hardcoded, adversary-owned command and control domain 9, indicating a reliance on direct communication channels for controlling compromised devices. Analysis of iocontrol revealed its support for basic commands such as arbitrary code execution, self-deletion, and port scanning 26. These capabilities provide the attackers with the means to remotely control infected devices, potentially move laterally within a network, and conceal their presence. Additionally, the use of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) through Cloudflare and domain fronting was observed, suggesting an effort to evade detection and hinder attribution 27.

The observed activities of Bauxit in 2024 strongly suggest a geopolitical motivation. The targeting of OT/IoT devices in Israel and the United States, coupled with the attribution to actors affiliated with Iran, indicates that these attacks are likely an extension of the ongoing geopolitical tensions between these nations into the cyber domain 14. Dragos's assessment of the reconnaissance activity in June 2024 as preparation for future disruptive operations points towards a potential objective of causing operational disruptions within targeted industries 9, with the ability to manipulate control systems potentially leading to significant safety and economic consequences. The defacement of Unitronics PLC/HMI devices in water treatment facilities in the US and Israel in late 2023, also attributed to CyberAv3ngers, suggests a motivation to instill fear and demonstrate their capacity to access critical infrastructure 14, a pattern that likely continued with the iocontrol attacks in 2024\. The specific targeting of fuel management systems could indicate an intent to disrupt energy supply chains or inflict economic damage 14. The development and deployment of custom malware like iocontrol, tailored for OT/IoT systems, indicates that Bauxit is a targeted and potentially sophisticated threat actor. Organizations with similar infrastructure should therefore implement robust defenses specifically designed to detect and mitigate such threats. The attribution of these activities to Iran-affiliated attackers further suggests a connection to state-sponsored cyber operations driven by geopolitical objectives, requiring organizations in nations perceived as adversaries to be particularly vigilant.

## **Threat Actor Profile: VOLTZITE (Volt Typhoon)**

VOLTZITE, a threat group tracked by Dragos, exhibits an overlap with the publicly known Volt Typhoon, which has been attributed to actors based in the People's Republic of China (PRC) 16. Throughout 2024, VOLTZITE maintained a focus on targeting critical infrastructure within the United States 9. In January 2024, Dragos identified VOLTZITE-controlled infrastructure actively interacting with a telecommunications provider in the United States 9. Additionally, network communications consistent with command-and-control (C2) beaconing were discovered originating from a major U.S. city's emergency service's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). While VOLTZITE had not yet demonstrated the capability to cause disruptions to industrial control systems, their consistent interest in U.S. critical infrastructure suggested a potential long-term campaign focused on data collection 9.

Following a law enforcement disruption of their "KV-Botnet" in January 2024, VOLTZITE reportedly initiated efforts to rebuild the botnet. Within a short period of just over a month, they successfully compromised numerous outdated Cisco and Netgear routers 9. The primary function of this rebuilt botnet appeared to be the obfuscation of malicious activities by routing traffic through the compromised, legitimate infrastructure 9. In July 2024, Dragos observed activity related to VOLTZITE targeting the United States, New Zealand, and Europe, following investigations into their operations in Guam and Palau 9. This activity involved the compromise of internet-facing small-office and home-office (SOHO) perimeter routers on the infrastructure of several electric and telecommunications internet service providers. The compromised routers were used to create adversary-controlled, peer-to-peer relay networks, which were subsequently utilized to target and enumerate internet-exposed infrastructure across various critical sectors 9. Scanning activity originating from the rebuilt KV-Botnet in late 2024 targeted the public-facing IP subnet ranges of organizations within the global energy, oil and natural gas, manufacturing, and defense industrial base sectors 9, indicating a continued focus on these strategically important industries.

The initial identification of VOLTZITE-controlled infrastructure interacting with a US telecommunications provider and the C2 beaconing from an EMS GIS in January 2024 highlights their early reconnaissance efforts and potential access within these vital sectors 9. The subsequent rebuilding and operation of the KV-Botnet throughout 2024, targeting vulnerable Cisco and Netgear routers, serves as a significant example of VOLTZITE's persistent efforts to maintain a covert infrastructure for their activities 9. The US Department of Justice's disruption of the botnet in December 2023 (announced in January 2024\) underscores the scale and concern associated with this operation 16. The compromise of SOHO routers in multiple countries to establish relay networks demonstrates VOLTZITE's sophisticated approach to obscuring their targeting of internet-exposed infrastructure across various critical sectors 9, a tactic that complicates attribution and detection efforts. The observed scanning activity from the KV-Botnet directed at specific critical infrastructure sectors indicates ongoing reconnaissance and potential target identification for future operations 9.

A key tactic employed by VOLTZITE is the use of the KV-Botnet, a covert network constructed by compromising vulnerable, end-of-life SOHO routers 16. This botnet is utilized for proxying manual operations against high-profile targets and for conducting scanning and reconnaissance activities, effectively blending malicious traffic with legitimate internet activity 22. VOLTZITE heavily relies on living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques, utilizing tools and commands already present within victim environments to conduct their operations stealthily and evade detection 22. This includes the use of native operating system tools for discovery, lateral movement, and credential access. Extensive pre-exploitation reconnaissance is a hallmark of VOLTZITE's operations. They conduct thorough research to understand target organizations' network architecture, operational protocols, security measures, and key personnel to tailor their attacks and enhance their operational security 23. VOLTZITE typically gains initial access by exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in public-facing network appliances such as routers, VPNs, and firewalls 23, often connecting via VPN for follow-on activities. Obtaining administrator credentials and achieving full domain compromise by extracting the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) from domain controllers is a common tactic used to gain elevated access and further infiltrate the network 23. VOLTZITE has also been observed using tools like PowerShell for targeted queries on Windows event logs to discreetly collect information while minimizing detection 23. The observed use of the frpc (Fast Reverse Proxy Client) tool, including a new variant in 2024, suggests a continued reliance on this type of utility for establishing covert communication channels 9.

The primary motivation behind VOLTZITE's activities appears to be pre-positioning within the IT networks of US critical infrastructure organizations to enable the potential disruption of OT functions in the event of future tensions or military conflicts 22. This represents a significant national security concern. The long-term data collection observed by Dragos suggests an additional objective of gathering intelligence that could be utilized to develop ICS-capable disruption tools or to inform strategic planning in a rapidly evolving global environment 9. The targeting of telecommunications and emergency services indicates an interest in systems critical for communication and response during emergency situations, potentially aiming to disrupt these capabilities during a conflict 9. The focus on sectors such as energy, oil and natural gas, manufacturing, and the defense industrial base aligns with the strategic importance of these industries to national security and economic stability 9. The persistent rebuilding and utilization of the KV-Botnet demonstrate a commitment to maintaining a robust and difficult-to-detect infrastructure for their operations 9. VOLTZITE's focus on critical infrastructure sectors and their pre-positioning activities signify a substantial national security threat, requiring heightened vigilance and proactive defense measures. The reliance on a botnet composed of compromised SOHO routers also underscores the importance of securing even seemingly less critical network devices, as they can be leveraged by sophisticated threat actors.

## **Expert Opinion on Root Cause Analysis of Key Incidents**

Analysis of the 2024 OT cybersecurity incidents reveals several recurring and critical root causes that organizations must address to enhance their security posture. One of the most prominent is the **vulnerability of internet-exposed OT/IoT devices**. The iocontrol attacks, as detailed by Claroty and Dragos, highlight the significant risks associated with directly connecting OT and IoT devices to the internet 5. These devices often lack the robust security features found in traditional IT systems, making them attractive targets for exploitation. The absence of proper network segmentation and inadequate firewall configurations exacerbate this issue, allowing attackers easy access to these vulnerable endpoints. This situation necessitates a fundamental shift towards zero-trust security principles within OT environments, coupled with the implementation of strong perimeter controls even within internal OT networks.

Another critical root cause is the **continued exploitation of known vulnerabilities in network infrastructure**. The activities of GRAPHITE and VOLTZITE, particularly through the KV-Botnet, clearly demonstrate the success threat actors have in leveraging unpatched vulnerabilities in network devices like routers 9. The persistent failure of organizations to apply timely security patches creates a significant window of opportunity for malicious actors. Implementing automated patch management systems and prioritizing security updates for all network infrastructure components are essential steps to mitigate this risk.

**Inadequate IT/OT segmentation** also emerged as a significant contributing factor to several incidents. The breach at American Water Works, as noted by Rockwell Automation, suggests that the lack of strong boundaries between IT and OT networks can lead to the propagation of attacks and broader disruptions 12. When these environments are tightly integrated without proper security controls, a compromise in the IT domain can readily spread to critical OT systems, and vice versa. Implementing robust network segmentation using firewalls, demilitarized zones (DMZs), and unidirectional gateways is crucial for containing breaches and preventing lateral movement to critical OT assets.

**Social engineering** remains a consistently effective initial access vector, as exemplified by Kaspersky's investigation into the SalmonSlalom campaign 13. Threat actors continue to exploit human vulnerabilities through tactics like phishing to gain an initial foothold within target networks. Investing in comprehensive security awareness training programs for all employees, including OT personnel, and implementing robust email security controls are vital to reducing the success rate of social engineering attacks.

Finally, the **targeting of end-of-life and unmanaged devices**, as seen with the KV-Botnet's exploitation of outdated Cisco and Netgear routers, underscores the risks associated with operating unsupported equipment 9. These devices often contain known vulnerabilities for which no patches are available, making them prime targets for attackers. Organizations must maintain a comprehensive inventory of all OT assets, including their end-of-life status, and develop a strategy for either upgrading or implementing compensating security controls for systems that cannot be updated.

A fundamental weakness underlying many of these incidents is the **lack of comprehensive asset inventory and vulnerability management programs**. Without a clear understanding of all connected devices and their security status, organizations struggle to effectively identify and address vulnerabilities. Furthermore, **insufficient network segmentation and access controls between IT and OT** remain prevalent vulnerabilities. The absence of clearly defined boundaries and strong authentication mechanisms allows attackers to move laterally within a network once initial access is gained. Many organizations also lack **adequate security monitoring and threat detection capabilities specifically tailored for OT environments**. Traditional IT security tools may not be effective in detecting malicious activity within OT networks due to the unique protocols and devices in use. **Weak password policies and the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, particularly for remote access to OT systems, continue to be exploited. Finally, there is often **insufficient training and awareness among OT personnel regarding cybersecurity threats**, making them more susceptible to social engineering and less likely to recognize suspicious activity. The recurring pattern of exploiting known vulnerabilities and targeting outdated infrastructure indicates a fundamental lack of proactive security measures in many OT organizations. A shift towards a more proactive "prevent and protect" strategy, emphasizing continuous security assessments and the implementation of security best practices throughout the OT lifecycle, is crucial. The American Water Works breach further highlights the risks associated with the increasing convergence of IT and OT networks, underscoring the need for a holistic security approach that considers the interconnectedness of these environments.

## **Insightful Opinions and Investment Recommendations for 2025**

To effectively address the evolving OT cybersecurity landscape in 2025, organizations must prioritize strategic investments and proactive security measures. **Enhanced OT visibility and monitoring solutions** are paramount. Investing in tools that provide deep insight into OT environments, including asset inventory, network traffic analysis, and anomaly detection, is crucial for identifying threats and understanding the security posture of OT assets 2. Without comprehensive visibility, organizations operate with a significant blind spot, hindering their ability to detect or respond to malicious activity within their OT networks.

Implementing **robust vulnerability management and patching programs** is equally critical. Establishing rigorous processes for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in OT devices and network infrastructure is essential. This includes regular vulnerability scanning, timely patching where feasible, and the utilization of virtual patching for legacy systems 18. Given that the exploitation of known vulnerabilities remains a primary attack vector, a proactive vulnerability management program significantly reduces the potential attack surface.

Organizations must also prioritize **strengthening network segmentation and access controls**. Implementing robust network segmentation to isolate critical OT zones from IT networks and the internet is essential. This should be coupled with strong access control mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication for all remote and local access to OT systems 10. Effective segmentation limits the potential damage of a security incident, preventing attackers from easily moving laterally within the network, while strong access controls ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with critical OT systems.

Investing in **improved threat detection and incident response capabilities** is also vital. This includes deploying OT-specific threat detection tools and developing comprehensive incident response plans that address the unique challenges of OT environments. Establishing clear communication channels and fostering collaboration between IT and OT security teams are also crucial 10. Early detection of malicious activity is paramount for minimizing the impact of an attack, and a well-defined incident response plan ensures a coordinated and effective response when an incident occurs.

**Enhanced security awareness and training for OT personnel** are necessary to educate them about the specific threats targeting industrial environments, social engineering tactics, and best practices for maintaining security in their day-to-day operations 12. Human error is a significant contributing factor to many security incidents, and a well-informed and security-conscious OT workforce can serve as a strong first line of defense.

Organizations should also implement thorough **supply chain and vendor risk management** processes to assess and mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with their OT supply chain and third-party vendors who may have access to their OT systems or data 7. The supply chain can be a vulnerable entry point for attackers, making the understanding and mitigation of these risks crucial for overall OT security.

Leveraging **proactive threat intelligence and threat hunting** capabilities is also recommended. Utilizing OT-specific threat intelligence feeds can help organizations stay informed about emerging threats, threat actors, and their TTPs. Implementing proactive threat hunting programs can help identify and mitigate potential risks before they are exploited 30. Staying ahead of the evolving threat landscape requires continuous monitoring of threat intelligence and proactive efforts to identify and neutralize potential threats.

Given the increasing need for **secure remote access** to OT systems, organizations should invest in solutions that go beyond traditional VPNs. Zero-trust network access (ZTNA) and other modern secure access technologies should be considered 5. Remote access is a frequently targeted attack vector, making the implementation of robust and modern secure access solutions essential for protecting OT environments.

As threat actors increasingly leverage **AI-powered threats**, organizations should also invest in security solutions that incorporate AI for threat detection and response. Staying informed about the potential for AI to be used in attacks against OT environments is also crucial 3. The cybersecurity landscape is rapidly evolving with the integration of AI, and organizations need to adapt their defenses accordingly.

Finally, organizations must develop a clear strategy to **address end-of-life and legacy systems** that cannot be easily patched or updated. This may involve network segmentation, implementing compensating controls, or planning for the eventual replacement of these systems 7. Legacy systems often contain known vulnerabilities and are prime targets for attackers, making a proactive plan to mitigate the risks associated with these systems essential.

To specifically address the threats posed by Bauxit (CyberAv3ngers), organizations should prioritize securing their OT/IoT devices, particularly those from the vendors targeted by the iocontrol malware 9. Implementing strong authentication, patching vulnerabilities, and monitoring network traffic for MQTT protocol anomalies are crucial. Given their geopolitical motivations, organizations in the US and Israel should be particularly vigilant. To counter the activities of VOLTZITE (Volt Typhoon), investments should focus on strengthening network infrastructure security, including timely patching of all network devices, especially routers and firewalls 16. Implementing robust logging and monitoring to detect living-off-the-land tactics is also essential 23. Given their focus on pre-positioning in critical infrastructure, organizations in the energy, water, communications, and transportation sectors in the US should prioritize these measures. The investment recommendations outlined above emphasize a layered security approach that addresses multiple aspects of OT cybersecurity, from foundational hygiene to advanced threat detection and emerging risks like AI. A single security measure is rarely sufficient to protect complex OT environments; a layered approach provides a more robust defense against a diverse range of threats. Furthermore, the alignment of these recommendations with the specific TTPs and motivations of threat actors like Bauxit and VOLTZITE ensures that the advice is tailored to the most relevant and pressing threats identified in 2024\.

## **Conclusions**

The analysis of the 2024 OT cybersecurity landscape reveals a persistent and evolving threat environment characterized by increased nation-state activity, the continued prevalence of ransomware, and the growing sophistication of threat actors. Incidents throughout the year underscore the critical importance of addressing fundamental security weaknesses, such as the exploitation of known vulnerabilities and the presence of inadequate network segmentation. The activities of threat actors like Bauxit and VOLTZITE highlight the targeted nature of attacks against critical infrastructure and the diverse motivations behind these campaigns, ranging from geopolitical objectives to intelligence gathering and potential future disruption.

Looking ahead to 2025, organizations must adopt a proactive and layered approach to OT security. Strategic investments in enhanced visibility, robust vulnerability management, strong network segmentation, improved threat detection and incident response, and comprehensive security awareness programs are essential. Furthermore, organizations must address the risks posed by their supply chains, prioritize the security of remote access solutions, prepare for the emergence of AI-powered threats, and develop mitigation strategies for end-of-life and legacy systems. By aligning security investments with the identified threat trends and the specific tactics of actors like Bauxit and VOLTZITE, organizations can significantly enhance their resilience and protect their critical industrial operations in the face of an increasingly complex cyber threat landscape.
