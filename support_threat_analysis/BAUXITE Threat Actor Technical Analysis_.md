# **Comprehensive Analysis of BAUXITE Threat Actor TTPs, Exploits, and Associated Vulnerabilities**

**1\. Executive Summary**

The cybersecurity landscape for industrial organizations is facing an increasing number of sophisticated threats, as highlighted in the 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report by Dragos, a leading authority in operational technology (OT) cybersecurity 1. This report identified BAUXITE as a newly discovered OT cyber threat group, underscoring a concerning trend of malicious actors shifting their focus towards industrial control systems 1. The emergence of OT-specific threat actors like BAUXITE indicates a significant evolution in the cyber threat landscape, with industrial environments now being considered prime targets alongside traditional IT infrastructure 1. The timing of the Dragos report, released in February 2025, provides a current snapshot of the evolving threats within the OT sector 1.

BAUXITE has already been implicated in numerous global campaigns targeting industrial entities and their specialized devices 1. The designation of "multiple global campaigns" suggests that BAUXITE is not an isolated or opportunistic actor but rather a well-organized group with sustained operations and a wide-reaching impact across the globe 1. The confirmed victims of BAUXITE are located in the United States, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, spanning critical sectors such as energy, water, food and beverage, and chemical manufacturing 1. This diverse targeting across geographical regions and essential industries points towards a broad and potentially strategic motivation, possibly aligning with overarching geopolitical objectives 1.

A significant aspect of the BAUXITE threat actor is its technical overlaps with the hacktivist persona CyberAv3ngers, a group with reported affiliations to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps — Cyber and Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC) 1. This connection strongly suggests a nation-state nexus for BAUXITE, implying the potential for advanced capabilities and politically driven objectives 1. Further analysis indicates that BAUXITE is capable of Stage 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain, signifying an ability to move beyond initial access and reconnaissance to developing and launching attacks on industrial infrastructure 2. This capability includes compromising Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and deploying custom backdoors on OT devices, highlighting a significant escalation in the threat level posed to industrial operations 2. Recent operational activities attributed to BAUXITE include targeting Sophos firewalls, exploiting exposed ICS devices, and compromising industrial remote access solutions, all with the apparent intention of causing disruption to targeted organizations 2.

**2\. Introduction to the BAUXITE Threat Actor**

The emergence of the BAUXITE threat actor was first brought to public attention through the Dragos 2025 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report 1. This annual publication from Dragos, now in its eighth iteration, serves as a crucial resource for understanding the evolving cybersecurity threats targeting industrial organizations 1. The report detailed a notable increase in ransomware attacks and the appearance of new malware specifically engineered for OT environments, providing a broader context for the identification of new threat groups like BAUXITE 1. The discovery of BAUXITE within this landscape of escalating OT threats underscores the growing complexity and severity of cyber risks facing industrial infrastructure 1.

While the naming convention for BAUXITE is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, the observed activity timeline indicates that the group has been active in multiple global campaigns since at least 2023 6. In 2024, Dragos reported that nine out of the 23 threat groups they track were actively engaged in OT operations, with BAUXITE being among them 1. During this period, BAUXITE was particularly active, conducting campaigns that appeared to be related to ongoing geopolitical conflicts 8. Looking ahead, projections suggest that BAUXITE will likely continue to evolve its capabilities and attempt to execute disruptive operations against OT/ICS entities worldwide throughout 2025 6. This timeline suggests a relatively recent but significant emergence of BAUXITE as a threat actor with increasing operational tempo and an anticipated growth in its malicious capabilities.

A key aspect in understanding BAUXITE is its strong connection to the pro-Iranian hacktivist persona known as CyberAv3ngers 2. Dragos's analysis indicates substantial technical overlaps between BAUXITE and CyberAv3ngers based on their observed capabilities and network infrastructure 2. Notably, CyberAv3ngers has been reported by the U.S. Government to have explicit affiliations with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps—Cyber and Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC) 5. Further information suggests that CyberAv3ngers is considered an operational arm of the Iranian government's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) 9. The primary focus of CyberAv3ngers' operations includes exploiting programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that are commonly used in critical infrastructure sectors like wastewater and irrigation, with a particular emphasis on devices manufactured in Israel 9. This established pattern of targeting by CyberAv3ngers, combined with the technical similarities to BAUXITE, strongly implies a common origin or direction, suggesting that BAUXITE's activities may also be linked to Iranian state interests and potentially driven by geopolitical motivations. The targeting preferences of CyberAv3ngers, particularly their focus on Israeli-made PLCs within the water and wastewater sectors, could offer valuable insights into potential future targets or the specific tactics that BAUXITE might employ, given their reported technical overlaps.

**3\. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) Analysis**

While specific details regarding BAUXITE's TTPs are somewhat limited in public reporting, likely to prevent the proliferation of their methods, insights can be drawn from their known activities and the established TTPs of the related CyberAv3ngers group. In terms of initial access, CyberAv3ngers has been observed exploiting internet-facing PLCs that were secured with default passwords or lacked password protection altogether, often connecting through default communication ports 10. Given the technical overlaps between BAUXITE and CyberAv3ngers, it is plausible that BAUXITE might also employ similar initial access techniques, targeting exposed OT devices that suffer from weak or default credentials. This highlights a continued vulnerability within OT environments stemming from inadequate basic security measures. Furthermore, reports indicate that CyberAv3ngers has utilized sophisticated methods for reconnaissance, including the use of AI tools like ChatGPT to gather intelligence on potential targets 9. This suggests a level of sophistication in pre-attack activities that BAUXITE might also possess.

Regarding execution, BAUXITE has demonstrated a significant capability to directly impact OT operations by compromising PLCs 2. Additionally, the group has been observed deploying custom backdoors on OT devices, indicating an ability to gain and potentially maintain unauthorized access 2. The related group, CyberAv3ngers, has also shown the capacity to gain control over critical infrastructure components, such as remote booster stations within water systems 12. Moreover, CyberAv3ngers has been directly observed manipulating settings on human-machine interfaces (HMIs), which are crucial for the operational control of industrial processes 14. These actions demonstrate that BAUXITE, likely through similar techniques, possesses the capability to not only infiltrate OT networks but also to establish a foothold and exert control over essential industrial control system components, potentially leading to significant operational disruptions.

In terms of persistence, the deployment of custom backdoors by BAUXITE 2 strongly suggests a deliberate effort to maintain long-term, unauthorized access to compromised OT environments. These backdoors would allow the threat actor to regain access even if initial entry points are secured or discovered.

While specific defense evasion techniques employed by BAUXITE are not publicly detailed, the actions of CyberAv3ngers offer some insight into potential methods. CyberAv3ngers has been known to disable critical functions on compromised PLCs, such as the ability to upload or download configurations, and has enabled password protection for upload settings, effectively locking out legitimate operators 10. They have also changed the default communication port numbers for remote access to PLCs, further hindering attempts at remediation 10. Additionally, CyberAv3ngers has refrained from writing their malicious logic directly to the PLC's non-volatile memory, making it more difficult to retrieve and analyze the attack payload 10. Furthermore, they have reset the software version of their uploaded ladder logic to an older version, which can prevent communication with standard engineering workstations used for management 10. It is highly probable that BAUXITE utilizes similar defense evasion tactics to complicate incident response efforts and prolong their control over compromised industrial systems.

The intended impact of BAUXITE's operations is clearly disruptive 2. This aligns with the activities of CyberAv3ngers, which are focused on objectives such as defacement of systems, spreading misinformation, and conducting ransomware campaigns 9. CyberAv3ngers has successfully defaced PLC screens with politically motivated anti-Israel messages 10 and has been implicated in gaining control of critical infrastructure like water system booster stations 12. In one instance, CyberAv3ngers tampered with water pumps and alarms, leading to a water tank overflow, demonstrating the potential for physical consequences resulting from their cyber operations 14. Given the technical connections and shared disruptive intentions, BAUXITE likely poses a significant threat of operational disruptions, including the manipulation of industrial processes and the potential for physical damage to critical infrastructure.

**4\. Exploited Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors**

Recent operational activity attributed to BAUXITE indicates a focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in network security appliances, specifically Sophos firewalls 2. This suggests that BAUXITE is actively identifying and leveraging weaknesses in these devices as a potential entry point into targeted industrial environments. Organizations utilizing Sophos firewalls should be particularly aware of this targeting trend and ensure their systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and configurations. In addition to firewalls, BAUXITE has also been observed targeting ICS devices that are directly exposed to the public internet 2. This tactic is echoed by CyberAv3ngers, who have similarly exploited internet-facing PLCs 10. The repeated targeting of exposed ICS devices by both actors underscores the critical importance of proper network segmentation and avoiding the direct exposure of OT/ICS assets to the internet.

Furthermore, BAUXITE has shown a propensity for targeting industrial remote access solutions 2. This indicates an attempt to compromise the secure channels used for managing and accessing industrial control systems from remote locations. Successful exploitation of remote access solutions could provide BAUXITE with significant control over OT environments. The Dragos report also highlights that BAUXITE has exploited fundamental security weaknesses such as default credentials and poor access controls 2. This mirrors the tactics of CyberAv3ngers, who likely gained initial access to Unitronics PLCs by authenticating to internet-connected devices using default or no passwords 10. This continued reliance on exploiting basic security oversights underscores the need for organizations to prioritize and enforce strong password policies and access control mechanisms within their OT environments.

While the provided information does not explicitly mention specific Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that have been exploited by BAUXITE, the targeting of Sophos firewalls suggests that publicly known vulnerabilities affecting these devices in late 2024 and early 2025 could be relevant 16. Similarly, while no CVEs are directly attributed to BAUXITE's compromise of exposed ICS devices or remote access solutions in these snippets, the vulnerabilities exploited by CyberAv3ngers in Unitronics PLCs, including the lack of initial password protection and vulnerabilities in the PCOM protocol (CVE-2024-38434, CVE-2024-38435) 21, could potentially be of interest given the reported technical overlaps between the two groups.

**5\. Case Studies of BAUXITE Activity**

The operational activities of BAUXITE are characterized by broad targeting across multiple industrial sectors and geographical regions 1. Confirmed victims span a range of critical infrastructure, including the energy sector (encompassing oil and natural gas, as well as electric power generation), water and wastewater treatment facilities, the food and beverage industry, and chemical manufacturing 1. This diverse sector focus suggests a potentially strategic objective aimed at impacting essential services on a wide scale. The geographical distribution of these victims includes organizations in the United States, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East, further highlighting the global reach of BAUXITE's operations and their capacity to target entities across different geopolitical landscapes 1.

While specific technical details of individual BAUXITE attacks are not extensively documented in publicly available sources, the general patterns of their activity provide some insight. BAUXITE has demonstrated the capability to gain control over critical OT components such as PLCs and to establish persistent access through the deployment of custom backdoors 2. Their recent campaigns have focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in network perimeter defenses like Sophos firewalls, targeting ICS devices that are inadvertently exposed to the internet, and compromising industrial remote access solutions 2. This pattern suggests a methodology that involves attempting to breach the network perimeter and then moving laterally within the OT environment to compromise critical assets. It is important to note that Dragos, as a cybersecurity firm specializing in OT/ICS threats, typically does not publicly disclose detailed technical information about specific threat group activities, except in extraordinary circumstances, to prevent the proliferation of attacker techniques 6. Consequently, detailed case studies with technical breakdowns of BAUXITE attacks are generally available through their threat intelligence platform, Dragos WorldView, rather than in public reports 6. This limited public information necessitates a reliance on the broader descriptions of their capabilities and targeting, as well as comparisons with related actors like CyberAv3ngers, to understand the potential nature and impact of BAUXITE's operations.

**6\. Comparison with CyberAv3ngers**

A significant aspect of understanding the BAUXITE threat actor is the reported substantial technical overlaps it shares with the hacktivist persona CyberAv3ngers 2. This strong technical connection suggests that BAUXITE likely employs similar tools, attack methodologies, and network infrastructure as CyberAv3ngers in its operations. Both actors demonstrate a focus on targeting critical infrastructure sectors. BAUXITE's targets include a broad range of industries such as energy, water, food and beverage, and chemical manufacturing 1. In contrast, CyberAv3ngers' primary modus operandi involves exploiting PLCs used in wastewater and irrigation systems, with a particular focus on Israeli-made devices 9. CyberAv3ngers has also targeted the broader water, food and beverage, and healthcare industries 9. While both groups target critical infrastructure, CyberAv3ngers appears to have a more specific focus on certain types of equipment and a geographical emphasis related to geopolitical tensions, whereas BAUXITE's targeting seems broader in both sector and geography.

The motivations attributed to the two actors also present some nuances. BAUXITE is described as having clear disruptive intentions 2. CyberAv3ngers, identified as a pro-Iranian hacktivist persona, is associated with defacement campaigns, the spread of misinformation, and ransomware attacks 1. CyberAv3ngers' actions often carry a strong political undertone, aligning with anti-Israel sentiment as seen in their defacement messages 10. While both actors aim to cause disruption, CyberAv3ngers' activities are more overtly politically motivated and sometimes involve hacktivist elements, whereas BAUXITE's motivations might be more strategic and less publicly proclaimed, potentially encompassing espionage or long-term disruption capabilities.

A key similarity lies in the likely attribution. Both BAUXITE and CyberAv3ngers are linked to Iran. CyberAv3ngers has explicit affiliations with the IRGC-CEC 1. The reported technical overlaps strongly suggest that BAUXITE also has a similar or shared origin, likely operating under the direction or influence of Iranian state-sponsored entities. This shared attribution reinforces the possibility of coordinated or directed activity between the two groups, potentially serving broader geopolitical objectives.

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Technical Overlaps | Substantial (capabilities and network infrastructure) | Shares technical overlaps with BAUXITE |
| Primary Targets | Broad industrial sectors (Energy, Water, Food & Beverage, Chemical Mfg) | PLCs in Wastewater & Irrigation (especially Israeli), Water, Food & Bev, Healthcare |
| Geographical Focus | Global (US, Europe, Australia, Middle East) | Primarily Israel and US (water sector) |
| Stated Motivations | Clear Disruptive Intentions | Defacement, Misinformation, Ransomware, Political (Anti-Israel) |
| Known Affiliations | Likely IRGC-CEC (through CyberAv3ngers) | Explicitly IRGC-CEC |
| Public Attack Details | Limited (Dragos WorldView) | More publicly documented (Unitronics PLC attacks) |

**7\. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations**

Given BAUXITE's observed targeting of Sophos firewalls, organizations should prioritize strengthening the security of their firewall infrastructure 2. This includes ensuring that firewalls are properly configured according to security best practices, promptly applying all available security patches, and implementing robust monitoring to detect any suspicious activity 2. Additionally, disabling WAN access via SSH and ensuring that the User Portal and Webadmin interfaces are not exposed to the public internet on firewalls can significantly reduce the attack surface 17.

Considering BAUXITE's capability to compromise PLCs 2, it is crucial to implement strong security measures directly on all ICS devices 2. This includes enforcing strong and unique passwords for all accounts, implementing strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege, and conducting regular vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate any weaknesses 2. Changing all default passwords on PLCs and HMIs, and implementing multi-factor authentication for any access to the OT network, are fundamental steps to mitigate this risk 10.

As BAUXITE has also targeted industrial remote access solutions 2, organizations must review and enhance the security of their remote connectivity protocols 2. This involves ensuring the use of strong passwords, implementing multi-factor authentication for all remote access attempts, and strictly adhering to the principle of least privilege to limit the scope of access granted 2. Restricting remote connections behind a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) or a zero-trust network access solution can add an essential layer of security 12.

The reported deployment of custom backdoors by BAUXITE 2 highlights the need for implementing OT-specific threat detection capabilities 2. Traditional IT security tools may not be equipped to identify the unique behaviors and protocols prevalent in OT environments. Continuous OT network monitoring and proactive threat hunting activities are essential to detect unusual or malicious activity that might indicate the presence of BAUXITE or similar threat actors 1.

Maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene across the entire organization is paramount. The exploitation of default credentials and poor access controls by BAUXITE 2 underscores the importance of fundamental security practices 2. This includes regularly patching and updating all systems, including firewalls and ICS devices, to address known vulnerabilities 2. Implementing network segmentation to isolate OT networks from IT networks and limit the potential for lateral movement by attackers is also a critical defensive measure 3.

Finally, organizations must stay informed about the latest threat intelligence concerning BAUXITE and other OT-focused threat actors 2. Proactive adaptation of security postures based on timely and accurate threat intelligence is crucial for effective defense. Leveraging resources such as Dragos WorldView, which provides detailed information on BAUXITE's TTPs and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), can significantly enhance an organization's ability to detect and respond to this evolving threat 6.

**8\. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

Due to the operational security practices of Dragos, specific network infrastructure details associated with BAUXITE are not publicly disclosed to limit the proliferation of their tradecraft 6. However, this information is likely available to network defenders through their threat intelligence services like Dragos WorldView 6. Similarly, while custom backdoors have been attributed to BAUXITE 2, specific file hashes for these malicious payloads are not provided in the available snippets. Developing and deploying custom YARA rules based on any future intelligence regarding the characteristics of these backdoors could aid in their detection.

Regarding network traffic patterns, the snippets do not offer specific patterns directly linked to BAUXITE. However, the activities of the related group, CyberAv3ngers, provide some potential clues. CyberAv3ngers has been observed communicating with Unitronics PLCs on default TCP port 20256, later changing it to 20257 10. While not directly applicable to BAUXITE's broader targeting, monitoring network traffic for connections to or from known malicious infrastructure (if such information becomes available through threat intelligence feeds) and observing unusual activity on standard OT communication ports could potentially help in detecting BAUXITE's presence or related activities.

**9\. Conclusion**

The analysis of available information indicates that BAUXITE is a significant and emerging threat actor targeting operational technology environments globally. With likely ties to the Iranian state-sponsored CyberAv3ngers group, BAUXITE possesses advanced capabilities aimed at disrupting critical infrastructure operations across a diverse range of sectors, including energy, water, food and beverage, and chemical manufacturing. Their operational history, though relatively recent, demonstrates a capacity to compromise core OT assets like PLCs and to establish persistent access.

Looking ahead, it is anticipated that BAUXITE will continue to refine its techniques and expand its targeting efforts throughout 2025\. Organizations within the identified sectors and geographical regions should remain highly vigilant and proactively implement the recommended mitigation strategies. Given the limited public disclosure of specific technical details regarding BAUXITE's attacks, subscribing to and leveraging commercial threat intelligence services, such as Dragos WorldView, is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of their tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as associated Indicators of Compromise. The dynamic nature of the OT threat landscape necessitates ongoing monitoring of threat activity, continuous adaptation of security measures based on the latest intelligence, and robust information sharing within the cybersecurity community to effectively defend against sophisticated actors like BAUXITE and maintain the resilience of critical industrial infrastructure.
