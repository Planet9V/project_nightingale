# Project Nightingale Comprehensive Codebase Analysis PRD
## Product Requirements Document for Systematic GTM System Evaluation

### Executive Summary
Conduct a comprehensive ultrathink analysis of the Project Nightingale codebase to catalog all products, artifacts, templates, and processes, then evaluate their integration with the OT-First engagement methodology and identify gaps in the sales/marketing execution pipeline.
