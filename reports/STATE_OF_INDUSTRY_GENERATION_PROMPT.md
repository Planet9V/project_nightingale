## ðŸ”§ Detailed Implementation Instructions

### 1. Research Phase Instructions

**Activate Extended Thinking Mode:**
```
<thinking>
I need to perform deep research across multiple sources to gather comprehensive intelligence for these sector reports. Let me deploy multiple research agents in parallel to maximize efficiency and coverage.
</thinking>
```

# Please note that there is an extensive mount of threat intelligence already gathereed and local. You are directed to catalogue key relevant topics and data and place into a temprorary "research_note" and be sure each Research Agent also examines the folder as well as external searches from this folder and subfolders; intelligence 

**Research Agent Deployment:**

```markdown
## Research Agent #1: Advisory Analysis
- Source: /Current_advisories_2025_7_1/*
- Focus: CISA advisories, ICS alerts, vulnerability disclosures
- Extract: CVEs, affected systems, threat actors, TTPs

## Research Agent #2: Sector Intelligence  
- Use: mcp__tavily__tavily-search
- Queries: "[Sector] cybersecurity incidents 2025", "[Sector] ransomware attacks", "[Sector] OT vulnerabilities"
- Time range: Last 30 days

## Research Agent #3: Threat Trends
- Use: mcp__brave__brave_web_search
- Focus: Emerging threat actors, new malware variants, attack campaigns
- Priority: Sector-specific threats

## Research Agent #4: Regulatory Updates
- Search: New regulations, compliance requirements, industry standards
- Sectors: Energy (NERC CIP), Manufacturing (NIST), Rail (TSA directives)
```
